2025-06-05 – Implemented `routes_video.py` and `routes_library.py` with
basic functionality. `backend/app/main.py` now imports these routers and
includes them under `/api/video` and `/api/library` prefixes.

2025-07-07 – Verified in current codebase. Both routers exist and are
registered. This TODO is considered **done**.
