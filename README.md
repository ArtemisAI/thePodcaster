# The Podcaster Project (Archived)

**This project, "The Podcaster," in its current form, has been archived.**

The development of The Podcaster, a local-first podcast automation platform, encountered several challenges that led to the decision to archive it. These included, but were not limited to:

*   **Frontend Development Hurdles:** Significant difficulties with the planned Node.js-based frontend tooling (React + Vite) led to a scope reduction, resulting in a simplified HTML/JavaScript interface that lacked many of the envisioned user experience features.
*   **Complexities in Core Features:** While many backend features were successfully implemented, areas like robust file uploading and management presented ongoing complexities.
*   **Project Scope:** The initial ambition, encompassing a wide array of features from a sophisticated waveform editor to full AI integration and publishing automation, proved to be very extensive for the development cycle.

A detailed analysis of the project's lifecycle, implemented features, encountered issues, and a summary of its planned roadmap versus actual status can be found in the post-mortem document.

**All original project files, including source code, documentation, changelogs, and the detailed post-mortem analysis, have been moved into the `/OUT` directory within this repository.** This has been done to preserve the work for potential future re-analysis, learning purposes, or if a decision is made to revive or repurpose parts of the project.

For a comprehensive understanding of the project's history and the reasons for its archival, please refer to the full post-mortem document:

## Revival Plan

While the `/OUT` directory preserves the archived implementation, a new development roadmap is available in `ROADMAP.md`. It outlines how to rebuild the project incrementally with testing at each phase.
