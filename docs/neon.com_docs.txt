AI Concepts
Learn how embeddings are used to build AI applications
Embeddings are an essential component in building AI applications. This topic describes embeddings and how they are used, generated, and stored in Postgres.
What are embeddings?
When working with unstructured data, a common objective is to transform it into a more structured format that is easier to analyze and retrieve. This transformation can be achieved through the use of 'embeddings', which are vectors containing an array of floating-point numbers that represent the features or dimensions of your data. For example, a sentence like "The cow jumped over the moon" might be represented by an embedding that looks like this: [0.5, 0.3, 0.1].
The advantage of embeddings is that they allow us to measure the similarity between different pieces of text. By calculating the distance between two embeddings, we can assess their relatedness - the smaller the distance, the greater the similarity, and vice versa. This quality is particularly useful as it enables embeddings to capture the underlying meaning of the text.
Take the following three sentences, for example:
Sentence 1: "The cow jumped over the moon."
Sentence 2: "The bovine leaped above the celestial body."
Sentence 3: "I enjoy eating pancakes."
You can determine the most similar sentences by following these steps:
Generate embeddings for each sentence. For illustrative purposes, assume these values represent actual embeddings:
Embedding for sentence 1 → [0.5, 0.3, 0.1]
Embedding for sentence 2 → [0.6, 0.29, 0.12]
Embedding for sentence 3 → [0.1, -0.2, 0.4]
Compute the distance between all pairs of embeddings (1 & 2, 2 & 3, and 1 & 3).
Identify the pair of embeddings with the shortest distance between them.
When we apply this process, it is likely that sentences 1 and 2, both of which involve jumping cattle, will emerge as the most related according to a distance calculation.
Vector similarity search
Transforming data into embeddings and computing similarities between one or more items is referred to as vector search or similarity search. This process has a wide range of applications, including:
Information retrieval:
By representing user queries as vectors, we can perform more accurate searches based on the meaning behind the queries, allowing us to retrieve more relevant information.
Natural language processing:
Embeddings capture the essence of the text, making them excellent tools for tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
Recommendation systems:
Using vector similarity, we can recommend items similar to a given item, whether they be movies, products, books, or otherwise. This technique allows us to create more personalized and relevant recommendations.
Anomaly detection:
By determining the similarity between items within a dataset, we can identify outliers or anomalies—items that don't quite fit the pattern. This can be crucial in many fields, from cybersecurity to quality control.
Distance metrics
Vector similarity search computes similarities (the distance) between data points. Calculating how far apart data points are helps us understand the relationship between them. Distance can be computed in different ways using different metrics. Some popular distance metrics include:
Euclidean (L2): Often referred to as the "ordinary" distance you'd measure with a ruler.
Manhattan (L1): Also known as "taxicab" or "city block" distance.
Cosine: This calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
Other distance metrics supported by the
pgvector
extension include
Hamming distance
and
Jaccard distance
.
Different distance metrics can be more appropriate for different tasks, depending on the nature of the data and the specific relationships you're interested in. For instance, cosine similarity is often used in text analysis.
Generating embeddings
A common approach to generating embeddings is to use an LLM API, such as
OpenAI’s Embeddings API
. This API allows you to input a text string into an API endpoint, which then returns the corresponding embedding. The "cow jumped over the moon" is a simplistic example with 3 dimensions. Most embedding models generate embeddings with a much larger number of dimensions. OpenAI's newest and most performant embedding models,
text-embedding-3-small
and
text-embedding-3-large
, generate embeddings with 1536 and 3072 dimensions by default, respectively.
Here's an example of how to use OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-small
model to generate an embedding:
curl
https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
\
-d
'{
"input": "Your text string goes here",
"model": "text-embedding-3-small"
}'
note
Running the command above requires an OpenAI API key, which must be obtained from
OpenAI
.
Upon successful execution, you'll receive a response similar to the following:
{
"object"
:
"list"
,
"data"
:
[
{
"object"
:
"embedding"
,
"index"
:
0
,
"embedding"
:
[
-0.006929283495992422
,
-0.005336422007530928
,
... (omitted for spacing)
-4.547132266452536e-05
,
-0.024047505110502243
]
,
}
]
,
"model"
:
"text-embedding-3-small"
,
"usage"
:
{
"prompt_tokens"
:
5
,
"total_tokens"
:
5
}
}
To learn more about OpenAI's embeddings, see
Embeddings
. Here, you'll find an example of obtaining embeddings from an
Amazon fine-food reviews
dataset supplied as a CSV file. See
Obtaining the embeddings
.
There are many embedding models you can use, such as those provided by Mistral AI, Cohere, Hugging Face, etc. AI tools like
LanngChain
provide interfaces and integrations for working with a variety of models. See
LangChain: Text embedding models
. You'll also find a
Neon Postgres guide
on the LangChain site and
Class NeonPostgres
, which provides an interface for working with a Neon Postgres database.
Storing vector embeddings in Postgres
Neon supports the
pgvector
Postgres extension, which enables the storage and retrieval of vector embeddings directly within your Postgres database. When building AI applications, installing this extension eliminates the need to extend your architecture to include a separate vector store. Installing the
pgvector
extension simply requires running the following
CREATE EXTENSION
statement from the
Neon SQL Editor
or any SQL client connected to your Neon Postgres database.
CREATE
EXTENSION vector;
After installing the
pgvector
extension, you can create a table to store your embeddings. For example, you might define a table similar to the following to store your embeddings:
CREATE
TABLE
items
(id
BIGSERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
, embedding VECTOR(
1536
));
To add embeddings to the table, you would insert the data as shown:
INSERT INTO
items(embedding)
VALUES
(
'[
-0.006929283495992422,
-0.005336422007530928,
...
-4.547132266452536e-05,
-0.024047505110502243
]'
);
For detailed information about using
pgvector
, refer to our guide:

# Neon Auth guidelines
## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing authentication in your application using both Stack Auth (frontend authentication system) and Neon Auth (database integration for user data). These systems work together to provide a complete authentication solution:
-
**Stack Auth**
: Handles user interface components, authentication flows, and client/server interactions
-
**Neon Auth**
: Manages how user data is stored and accessed in your database
## Stack Auth Setup Guidelines
### Initial Setup
- Run the installation wizard with:
`npx @stackframe/init-stack@latest`
- Update your API keys in your
`.env.local`
file:
-
`NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID`
-
`NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
-
`STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY`
- Key files created/updated include:
-
`app/handler/[...stack]/page.tsx`
(default auth pages)
-
`app/layout.tsx`
(wrapped with StackProvider and StackTheme)
-
`app/loading.tsx`
(provides a Suspense fallback)
-
`stack.ts`
(initializes your Stack server app)
### UI Components
- Use pre-built components from
`@stackframe/stack`
like
`<UserButton />`
,
`<SignIn />`
, and
`<SignUp />`
to quickly set up auth UI.
- You can also compose smaller pieces like
`<OAuthButtonGroup />`
,
`<MagicLinkSignIn />`
, and
`<CredentialSignIn />`
for custom flows.
- Example:
```tsx
import { SignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';
export default function Page() {
return <SignIn />;
}
```
### User Management
- In Client Components, use the
`useUser()`
hook to retrieve the current user (it returns
`null`
when not signed in).
- Update user details using
`user.update({...})`
and sign out via
`user.signOut()`
.
- For pages that require a user, call
`useUser({ or: "redirect" })`
so unauthorized visitors are automatically redirected.
### Client Component Integration
- Client Components rely on hooks like
`useUser()`
and
`useStackApp()`
.
- Example:
```tsx
"use client";
import { useUser } from "@stackframe/stack";
export function MyComponent() {
const user = useUser();
return <div>{user ? `Hello, ${user.displayName}` : "Not logged in"}</div>;
}
```
### Server Component Integration
- For Server Components, use
`stackServerApp.getUser()`
from your
`stack.ts`
file.
- Example:
```tsx
import { stackServerApp } from "@/stack";
export default async function ServerComponent() {
const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();
return <div>{user ? `Hello, ${user.displayName}` : "Not logged in"}</div>;
}
```
### Page Protection
- Protect pages by:
- Using
`useUser({ or: "redirect" })`
in Client Components.
- Using
`await stackServerApp.getUser({ or: "redirect" })`
in Server Components.
- Implementing middleware that checks for a user and redirects to
`/handler/sign-in`
if not found.
- Example middleware:
```tsx
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
const user = await stackServerApp.getUser();
if (!user) {
return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/handler/sign-in', request.url));
}
return NextResponse.next();
}
export const config = { matcher: '/protected/:path*' };
```
## Neon Auth Database Integration
### Database Schema
Neon Auth creates and manages a schema in your database that stores user information:
-
**Schema Name**
:
`neon_auth`
-
**Primary Table**
:
`users_sync`
-
**Table Structure**
:
-
`raw_json`
(JSONB, NOT NULL): Complete user data in JSON format
-
`id`
(TEXT, NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY): Unique user identifier
-
`name`
(TEXT, NULLABLE): User's display name
-
`email`
(TEXT, NULLABLE): User's email address
-
`created_at`
(TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, NULLABLE): When the user was created
-
`deleted_at`
(TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, NULLABLE): When the user was deleted (if applicable)
-
**Indexes**
:
-
`users_sync_deleted_at_idx`
on
`deleted_at`
: For quickly identifying deleted users
### Schema Creation SQL
```sql
-- Create schema if it doesn't exist
CREATE
SCHEMA
IF
NOT
EXISTS
neon_auth;
-- Create the users_sync table
CREATE
TABLE
neon_auth
.users_sync (
raw_json JSONB
NOT NULL
,
id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
name
TEXT
,
email
TEXT
,
created_at
TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
,
deleted_at
TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
,
PRIMARY KEY
(id)
);
-- Create index on deleted_at
CREATE
INDEX
users_sync_deleted_at_idx
ON
neon_auth.users_sync (deleted_at);
```
### Database Usage
#### Querying Users
To fetch active users from Neon Auth:
```sql
SELECT
*
FROM
neon_auth.users_sync
WHERE
deleted_at
IS
NULL
;
```
#### Relating User Data with Application Tables
To join user data with your application tables:
```sql
SELECT
t.
*
,
u.id
AS
user_id,
u.name
AS
user_name,
u.email
AS
user_email
FROM
public.todos t
LEFT JOIN
neon_auth.users_sync u
ON
t.owner
=
u.id
WHERE
u.deleted_at
IS
NULL
ORDER BY
t.id;
```
## Stack Auth SDK Reference
The Stack Auth SDK provides several types and methods:
```tsx
type StackClientApp = {
new(options): StackClientApp;
getUser([options]): Promise<User>;
useUser([options]): User;
getProject(): Promise<Project>;
useProject(): Project;
signInWithOAuth(provider): void;
signInWithCredential([options]): Promise<...>;
signUpWithCredential([options]): Promise<...>;
sendForgotPasswordEmail(email): Promise<...>;
sendMagicLinkEmail(email): Promise<...>;
};
type StackServerApp =
& StackClientApp
& {
new(options): StackServerApp;
getUser([id][, options]): Promise<ServerUser | null>;
useUser([id][, options]): ServerUser;
listUsers([options]): Promise<ServerUser[]>;
useUsers([options]): ServerUser[];
createUser([options]): Promise<ServerUser>;
getTeam(id): Promise<ServerTeam | null>;
useTeam(id): ServerTeam;
listTeams(): Promise<ServerTeam[]>;
useTeams(): ServerTeam[];
createTeam([options]): Promise<ServerTeam>;
}
type CurrentUser = {
id: string;
displayName: string | null;
primaryEmail: string | null;
primaryEmailVerified: boolean;
profileImageUrl: string | null;
signedUpAt: Date;
hasPassword: boolean;
clientMetadata: Json;
clientReadOnlyMetadata: Json;
selectedTeam: Team | null;
update(data): Promise<void>;
updatePassword(data): Promise<void>;
getAuthHeaders(): Promise<Record<string, string>>;
getAuthJson(): Promise<{ accessToken: string | null }>;
signOut([options]): Promise<void>;
delete(): Promise<void>;
getTeam(id): Promise<Team | null>;
useTeam(id): Team | null;
listTeams(): Promise<Team[]>;
useTeams(): Team[];
setSelectedTeam(team): Promise<void>;
createTeam(data): Promise<Team>;
leaveTeam(team): Promise<void>;
getTeamProfile(team): Promise<EditableTeamMemberProfile>;
useTeamProfile(team): EditableTeamMemberProfile;
hasPermission(scope, permissionId): Promise<boolean>;
getPermission(scope, permissionId[, options]): Promise<TeamPermission | null>;
usePermission(scope, permissionId[, options]): TeamPermission | null;
listPermissions(scope[, options]): Promise<TeamPermission[]>;
usePermissions(scope[, options]): TeamPermission[];
listContactChannels(): Promise<ContactChannel[]>;
useContactChannels(): ContactChannel[];
};
```
## Best Practices for Integration
### Stack Auth Best Practices
- Use the appropriate methods based on component type:
- Use hook-based methods (
`useXyz`
) in Client Components
- Use promise-based methods (
`getXyz`
) in Server Components
- Always protect sensitive routes using the provided mechanisms
- Use pre-built UI components whenever possible to ensure proper auth flow handling
### Neon Auth Best Practices
- Always use
`LEFT JOIN`
when relating with
`neon_auth.users_sync`
- Ensures queries work even if user records are missing
- Always filter out users with
`deleted_at IS NOT NULL`
- Prevents deleted user accounts from appearing in queries
- Never create Foreign Key constraints pointing to
`neon_auth.users_sync`
- User management happens externally and could break referential integrity
- Never insert users directly into the
`neon_auth.users_sync`
table
- User creation and management must happen through the Stack Auth system
## Integration Flow
1. User authentication happens via Stack Auth UI components
2. User data is automatically synced to the
`neon_auth.users_sync`
table
3. Your application code accesses user information either through:
- Stack Auth hooks/methods (in React components)
- SQL queries to the
`neon_auth.users_sync`
table (for data operations)
## Example: Custom Profile Page with Database Integration
### Frontend Component
```tsx
'use client';
import { useUser, useStackApp, UserButton } from '@stackframe/stack';
export default function ProfilePage() {
const user = useUser({ or: "redirect" });
const app = useStackApp();
return (
<div>
<UserButton />
<h1>Welcome, {user.displayName || "User"}</h1>
<p>Email: {user.primaryEmail}</p>
<button onClick={() => user.signOut()}>Sign Out</button>
</div>
);
}
```
### Database Query for User's Content
```sql
-- Get all todos for the currently logged in user
SELECT
t.
*
FROM
public.todos t
LEFT JOIN
neon_auth.users_sync u
ON
t.owner
=
u.id
WHERE
u.id
=
$current_user_id
AND
u.deleted_at
IS
NULL
ORDER BY
t.created_at
DESC
;
```

# Neon and Drizzle integration guidelines
## Overview
This guide covers the specific integration patterns and optimizations for using
**Drizzle ORM**
with
**Neon**
serverless Postgres databases. Follow these guidelines to ensure efficient database operations in serverless environments.
## Dependencies
For Neon with Drizzle ORM integration, include these specific dependencies:
```bash
npm install drizzle-orm @neondatabase/serverless dotenv
npm install -D drizzle-kit
```
## Neon Connection Configuration
- Always use the Neon connection string format:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@ep-instance-id.region.aws.neon.tech/neondb
```
- Store this in
`.env`
or
`.env.local`
file
## Neon Connection Setup
When connecting to Neon specifically:
- Use the
`neon`
client from
`@neondatabase/serverless`
package
- Pass the connection string to create the SQL client
- Use
`drizzle`
with the
`neon-http`
adapter specifically
```typescript
// src/db.ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { config } from 'dotenv';
// Load environment variables
config({ path: '.env' });
if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
throw new Error('DATABASE_URL is not defined');
}
// Create Neon SQL client - specific to Neon
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
// Create Drizzle instance with neon-http adapter
export const db = drizzle({ client: sql });
```
## Neon Database Considerations
### Default Settings
- Neon projects come with a ready-to-use database named
`neondb`
- Default role is typically
`neondb_owner`
- Connection strings include the correct endpoint based on your region
### Serverless Optimization
Neon is optimized for serverless environments:
- Use the HTTP-based
`neon-http`
adapter instead of node-postgres
- Take advantage of connection pooling for serverless functions
- Consider Neon's auto-scaling capabilities when designing schemas
## Schema Considerations for Neon
When defining schemas for Neon:
- Use Postgres-specific types from
`drizzle-orm/pg-core`
- Leverage Postgres features that Neon supports:
- JSON/JSONB columns
- Full-text search
- Arrays
- Enum types
```typescript
// src/schema.ts
import { pgTable, serial, text, integer, timestamp, jsonb, pgEnum } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';
// Example of Postgres-specific enum with Neon
export const userRoleEnum = pgEnum('user_role', ['admin', 'user', 'guest']);
export const usersTable = pgTable('users', {
id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
name: text('name').notNull(),
email: text('email').notNull().unique(),
role: userRoleEnum('role').default('user'),
metadata: jsonb('metadata'), // Postgres JSONB supported by Neon
// Other columns
});
// Export types
export type User = typeof usersTable.$inferSelect;
export type NewUser = typeof usersTable.$inferInsert;
```
## Drizzle Config for Neon
Neon-specific configuration in
`drizzle.config.ts`
:
```typescript
// drizzle.config.ts
import { config } from 'dotenv';
import { defineConfig } from 'drizzle-kit';
config({ path: '.env' });
export default defineConfig({
schema: './src/schema.ts',
out: './migrations',
dialect: 'postgresql', // Neon uses Postgres dialect
dbCredentials: {
url: process.env.DATABASE_URL!,
},
// Optional: Neon project specific tables to include/exclude
// includeTables: ['users', 'posts'],
// excludeTables: ['_migrations'],
});
```
## Neon-Specific Query Optimizations
### Efficient Queries for Serverless
Optimize for Neon's serverless environment:
- Keep connections short-lived
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Batch operations when possible
```typescript
// Example of optimized query for Neon
import { db } from '../db';
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { usersTable } from '../schema';
export async function batchInsertUsers(users: NewUser[]) {
// More efficient than multiple individual inserts on Neon
return db.insert(usersTable).values(users).returning();
}
// For complex queries, use prepared statements
export const getUsersByRolePrepared = db
.select()
.from(usersTable)
.where(sql`${usersTable.role} = $1`)
.prepare('get_users_by_role');
// Usage: getUsersByRolePrepared.execute(['admin'])
```
### Transaction Handling with Neon
Neon supports transactions through Drizzle:
```typescript
import { db } from '../db';
import { usersTable, postsTable } from '../schema';
export async function createUserWithPosts(user: NewUser, posts: NewPost[]) {
return await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
const [newUser] = await tx.insert(usersTable).values(user).returning();
if (posts.length > 0) {
await tx.insert(postsTable).values(
posts.map((post) => ({
...post,
userId: newUser.id,
}))
);
}
return newUser;
});
}
```
## Working with Neon Branches
Neon supports database branching for development and testing:
```typescript
// Using different Neon branches with environment variables
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
// For multi-branch setup
const getBranchUrl = () => {
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV;
if (env === 'development') {
return process.env.DEV_DATABASE_URL;
} else if (env === 'test') {
return process.env.TEST_DATABASE_URL;
}
return process.env.DATABASE_URL;
};
const sql = neon(getBranchUrl()!);
export const db = drizzle({ client: sql });
```
## Neon-Specific Error Handling
Handle Neon-specific connection issues:
```typescript
import { db } from '../db';
import { usersTable } from '../schema';
export async function safeNeonOperation<T>(operation: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
try {
return await operation();
} catch (error: any) {
// Handle Neon-specific error codes
if (error.message?.includes('connection pool timeout')) {
console.error('Neon connection pool timeout');
// Handle appropriately
}
// Re-throw for other handling
throw error;
}
}
// Usage
export async function getUserSafely(id: number) {
return safeNeonOperation(() => db.select().from(usersTable).where(eq(usersTable.id, id)));
}
```
## Best Practices for Neon with Drizzle
1.
**Connection Management**
- Keep connection times short for serverless functions
- Use connection pooling for high traffic applications
2.
**Neon Features**
- Utilize Neon branching for development and testing
- Consider Neon's auto-scaling for database design
3.
**Query Optimization**
- Batch operations when possible
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Optimize complex joins to minimize data transfer
4.
**Schema Design**
- Leverage Postgres-specific features supported by Neon
- Use appropriate indexes for your query patterns
- Consider Neon's performance characteristics for large tables

# Neon Serverless Guidelines
## Overview
This guide provides specific patterns and best practices for connecting to Neon databases in serverless environments. Follow these guidelines to ensure efficient database connections, proper query handling, and optimal performance in functions with ephemeral runtimes.
## Installation
Install the Neon Serverless PostgreSQL driver with the correct package name:
```bash
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
```
```bash
bunx
jsr
add
@neon/serverless
```
For projects that depend on pg but want to use Neon:
```json
"dependencies"
: {
"pg"
:
"npm:@neondatabase/serverless@^0.10.4"
},
"overrides"
: {
"pg"
:
"npm:@neondatabase/serverless@^0.10.4"
}
```
Avoid incorrect package names like
`neon-serverless`
or
`pg-neon`
.
## Connection String
Use environment variables for database connection strings:
```javascript
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
```
Never hardcode credentials:
```javascript
// Don't do this
const sql = neon('postgres://username:password@host.neon.tech/neondb');
```
## Parameter Interpolation
Use template literals with the SQL tag for safe parameter interpolation:
```javascript
const [post] = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
```
Don't concatenate strings directly (SQL injection risk):
```javascript
// Don't do this
const [post] = await sql('SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ' + postId);
```
## WebSocket Environments
Configure WebSocket support for Node.js v21 and earlier:
```javascript
import { Pool, neonConfig } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import ws from 'ws';
// Configure WebSocket support for Node.js
neonConfig.webSocketConstructor = ws;
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
```
## Serverless Lifecycle Management
In serverless environments, create, use, and close connections within a single request handler:
```javascript
export default async (req, ctx) => {
// Create pool inside request handler
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
try {
const { rows } = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users');
return new Response(JSON.stringify(rows));
} finally {
// Close connection before response completes
ctx.waitUntil(pool.end());
}
};
```
Avoid creating connections outside request handlers as they won't be properly closed.
## Query Functions
Choose the appropriate query function based on your needs:
```javascript
// For simple one-shot queries (uses fetch, fastest)
const [post] = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
// For multiple queries in a single transaction
const [posts, tags] = await sql.transaction([
sql`SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 10`,
sql`SELECT * FROM tags`,
]);
// For session/transaction support or compatibility with libraries
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
const client = await pool.connect();
```
Use
`neon()`
for simple queries rather than
`Pool`
when possible, and use
`transaction()`
for multiple related queries.
## Transactions
Use proper transaction handling with error management:
```javascript
// Using transaction() function for simple cases
const [result1, result2] = await sql.transaction([
sql`INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES(${name}) RETURNING id`,
sql`INSERT INTO profiles(user_id, bio) VALUES(${userId}, ${bio})`,
]);
// Using Client for interactive transactions
const client = await pool.connect();
try {
await client.query('BEGIN');
const {
rows: [{ id }],
} = await client.query('INSERT INTO users(name) VALUES($1) RETURNING id', [name]);
await client.query('INSERT INTO profiles(user_id, bio) VALUES($1, $2)', [id, bio]);
await client.query('COMMIT');
} catch (err) {
await client.query('ROLLBACK');
throw err;
} finally {
client.release();
}
```
Always include proper error handling and rollback mechanisms.
## Environment-Specific Optimizations
Apply environment-specific optimizations for best performance:
```javascript
// For Vercel Edge Functions, specify nearest region
export const config = {
runtime: 'edge',
regions: ['iad1'], // Region nearest to your Neon DB
};
// For Cloudflare Workers, consider using Hyperdrive instead
// https://neon.com/blog/hyperdrive-neon-faq
```
## Error Handling
Implement proper error handling for database operations:
```javascript
// Pool error handling
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
pool.on('error', (err) => {
console.error('Unexpected error on idle client', err);
process.exit(-1);
});
// Query error handling
try {
const [post] = await sql`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = ${postId}`;
if (!post) {
return new Response('Not found', { status: 404 });
}
} catch (err) {
console.error('Database query failed:', err);
return new Response('Server error', { status: 500 });
}
```
## Library Integration
Properly integrate with query builders and ORM libraries:
```javascript
// Kysely integration
import { Pool } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
import { Kysely, PostgresDialect } from 'kysely';
const dialect = new PostgresDialect({
pool: new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }),
});
const db = new Kysely({
dialect,
// schema definitions...
});
```
Don't attempt to use the
`neon()`
function directly with ORMs that expect a Pool interface.

How it works
AI rules are
.mdc
files that specify which types of files they apply to (such as
*.tsx
or
schema.sql
). When you're working with a matching file, your AI tool automatically applies the relevant rules to provide better suggestions.
Example: AI rules in action
Here's a practical example using
Cursor
. A developer has implemented authentication in their server-rendered page and wants to confirm best practices:
Developer query
:
"Using the neon-auth.mdc rule, how do I secure a server-rendered page?"

Scale your AI application with Neon
Scale your AI application with Neon's Autoscaling and Read Replica features
You can scale your AI application built on Postgres with
pgvector
in the same way you would any Postgres app: Vertically with added CPU, RAM, and storage, or horizontally with read replicas.
In Neon, scaling vertically is a matter of selecting the desired compute size. Neon supports compute sizes ranging from .025 vCPU with 1 GB RAM up to 56 vCPU with 224 GB RAM. Autoscaling is supported up to 16 vCPU. Larger computes are fixed size computes (no autoscaling). The
maintenance_work_mem
values shown below are approximate.

See
Edit a compute
to learn how to configure your compute size. Available compute sizes differ according to your Neon plan. The Neon Free Plan supports computes starting at 0.25 CU, up to 2 CU with autoscaling enabled. The Launch plan offers compute sizes up to 4 CU. Larger computes are available on the Scale and Business plans. See
Neon plans
.
To optimize
pgvector
index build time, you can increase the
maintenance_work_mem
setting for the current session beyond the preconfigured default shown in the table above with a command similar to this:
SET
maintenance_work_mem
=
'10 GB'
;
The recommended
maintenance_work_mem
setting is your working set size (the size of your tuples for vector index creation). However, your
maintenance_work_mem
setting should not exceed 50 to 60 percent of your compute's available RAM (see the table above). For example, the
maintenance_work_mem='10 GB'
setting shown above has been successfully tested on a 7 CU compute, which has 28 GB of RAM, as 10 GB is less than 50% of the RAM available for that compute size.
Autoscaling
You can also enable Neon's autoscaling feature for automatic scaling of compute resources (vCPU and RAM). Neon's
Autoscaling
feature automatically scales up compute on demand in response to application workload and down to zero on inactivity.
For example, if your AI application experiences heavy load during certain hours of the day or at different times throughout the week, month, or calendar year, Neon automatically scales compute resources without manual intervention according to the compute size boundaries that you configure. This enables you to handle peak demand while avoiding consuming compute resources during periods of low activity.
Enabling autoscaling is also recommended for initial data loads and memory-intensive index builds to ensure sufficient compute resources for this phase of your AI application setup.
To learn more about Neon's autoscaling feature and how to enable it, refer to our
Autoscaling guide
.
Storage
Neon's data storage allowances differ by plan. The Free plan offers 512 MB of storage. The Launch, Scale, and Business plans support larger data sizes and purchasing additional units of storage. See
Neon plans
.
Read replicas
Neon supports read replicas, which are independent read-only computes designed to perform read operations on the same data as your primary read-write compute. Read replicas do not replicate data across database instances. Instead, read requests are directed to the same data source. This architecture enables read replicas to be created instantly, enabling you to scale out CPU and RAM, but because data is read from a single source, there are no additional storage costs.
Since vector similarity search is a read-only workload, you can leverage read replicas to offload reads from your primary read-write compute to a dedicated compute when deploying AI applications. After you create a read replica, you can simply swap out your current Neon connecting string for the read replica connection string, which makes deploying a read replica for your AI application very simple.
Neon's read replicas support the same compute sizes outlined above. Read replicas also support autoscaling.
To learn more about the Neon read replicas, see
read replicas
and refer to our
Working with Neon read replicas
guide.

Optimize pgvector search
Fine-tune parameters for efficient and accurate similarity searches in Postgres
This guide explores how to effectively use
pgvector
for vector similarity searches in your AI applications. We'll address the following key questions:
How to profile your vector search queries, when using
pgvector
?
When to use indexes and tradeoffs between the available options?
Which parameters to tune for best performance?
We'll examine sequential scans, HNSW indexing, and IVFFlat indexing, providing benchmarks and practical recommendations for various dataset sizes. This will help you optimize
pgvector
queries in your Neon database for both accuracy and speed.
Without indexes,
pgvector
performs a sequential scan on the database and calculates the distance between the query vector and all vectors in the table. This approach does an exact search and guarantees 100%
recall
, but it can be costly with large datasets.
what is recall?
Recall is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a search algorithm. It measures how effectively the search retrieves relevant items from a dataset. It is defined as the ratio of the number of relevant items retrieved by the search to the total number of relevant items in the dataset.
The query below uses
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
to generate an execution plan and display the performance of the similarity search query.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE

FROM

ORDER BY

This is what the query plan looks like:

You can see in the plan that the query performs a sequential scan (
Seq Scan
) on the
items
table, which means that the query compares the query vector against all vectors in the
items
table. In other words, the query does not use an index.
To understand how queries perform at scale, we tested sequential scan vector searches with
pgvector
on subsets of the
GIST-960 dataset
with 10k, 50k, 100k, 500k, and 1M rows using a Neon database instance with 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of RAM.
The sequential scan search performed reasonably well for tables with 10k rows (~36ms). However, sequential scans start to become costly at 50k rows.
So, when should you use sequential scans rather than defining an index?
When your dataset is small and you do not intend to scale it.
When you need 100% recall (accuracy). Adding indexes trades recall for performance.
When you do not expect a high volume of queries per second, which would require indexes for performance.
Otherwise, consider adding an index for better performance.
Indexing with HNSW
HNSW is a graph-based approach to indexing multi-dimensional data. It constructs a multi-layered graph, where each layer is a subset of the previous one. During a vector similarity search, the algorithm navigates through the graph from the top layer to the bottom to quickly find the nearest neighbor. An HNSW graph is known for its superior performance in terms of speed and accuracy.
note
An HNSW index performs better than IVFFlat (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff) and can be created without any data in the table since there isn’t a training step like there is for an IVFFlat index. However, HNSW indexes have slower build times and use more memory.
The search process begins at the topmost layer of the HNSW graph. From the starting node, the algorithm navigates to the nearest neighbor in the same layer. The algorithm repeats this step until it can no longer find neighbors more similar to the query vector.
Using the found node as an entry point, the algorithm moves down to the next layer in the graph and repeats the process of navigating to the nearest neighbor. The process of navigating to the nearest neighbor and moving down a layer is repeated until the algorithm reaches the bottom layer.
In the bottom layer, the algorithm continues navigating to the nearest neighbor until it cannot find any nodes that are more similar to the query vector. The current node is then returned as the most similar node to the query vector.
The key idea behind HNSW is that by starting the search at the top layer and moving down through each layer, the algorithm can quickly navigate to the area of the graph that contains the node that is most similar to the query vector. This makes the search process much faster than if it had to search through every node in the graph.
Tuning the HNSW algorithm
The following options allow you to tune the HNSW algorithm when creating an index:
m
: Defines the maximum number of links created for each node during graph construction. A higher value increases accuracy (recall), but it also increases the size of the index in memory and index construction time. Higher values are typically used with high-dimensionality datasets or when a high degree of accuracy is required. The default value is 16. Acceptable values for m typically fall between 2 and 100. For many applications, beginning with a range of 12 to 48 is advisable.
ef_construction
: Defines the size of the list for the nearest neighbors. This value influences the tradeoff between index quality and construction speed. A high
ef_construction
value creates a higher quality graph, enabling more accurate search results but also means that index construction takes longer. The value should be set to at least twice the value of
m
. The default setting is 64. There comes a point where increasing
ef_construction
no longer improves index quality. To evaluate search accuracy, you can start by setting
ef_construction
equal to
ef_search
and incrementally increasing
ef_construction
to achieve the desired result. If accuracy is lower than 0.9, there may be opportunity for improvement by increasing
ef_construction
.
This example demonstrates how to set the parameters:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH
(m
=
16
, ef_construction
=
64
);
HNSW search tuning:
ef_search
: Defines the size of the dynamic candidate list for search. The default value is 40. This value influences the trade-off between query accuracy (recall) and speed. A higher value increases accuracy at the cost of speed. The value should be equal to or larger than
k
, which is the number of nearest neighbors you want your search to return (defined by the
LIMIT
clause in your
SELECT
query).
To configure this value, do so using a
SET
statement before executing queries:
SET
hnsw.ef_search
=
100
;
You can also use
SET LOCAL
inside a transaction to set it for a single query:
BEGIN
;
SET
LOCAL
hnsw.ef_search
=
100
;
SELECT
...
COMMIT
;
In summary:
To prioritize search speed over accuracy, use lower values for
m
and
ef_search
.
Conversely, to prioritize accuracy over search speed, use a higher value for
m
and
ef_search
.
Using a higher value for
ef_construction
yields more accurate search results at the cost of index build time.
Indexing with IVFFlat
IVFFlat indexes partition the dataset into clusters ("lists") to optimize for vector search.
You can create an IVFFlat index using the query below:
CREATE
INDEX
items_embedding_cosine_idx
ON
items
USING
ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH
(lists
=
1000
);
IVFFlat in
pgvector
has two parameters:
lists
This parameter specifies the number of
k-means clusters
(or "lists") to divide the dataset into
Each cluster contains a subset of the data, and each data point belongs to the closest cluster centroid.
probes
This parameter determines the number of lists to explore during the search for the nearest neighbors.
By probing multiple lists, the search algorithm can find the closest points more accurately, balancing between speed and accuracy.
By default, the
probes
parameter is set to
1
. This means that during a search, only one cluster is explored. This approach is fine if your query vector is close to the centroid. However, if the query vector is located near the edge of the cluster, closer neighbors in adjacent clusters will not be included in the search, which can result in a lower recall.
You must specify the number of probes in the same connection as the search query:
SET
ivfflat.probes
=
100
;
SET
enable_seqscan
=off
;
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
embedding
<->
'[0.011699999682605267,..., 0.008700000122189522]'
LIMIT
100
;
note
In the example above,
enable_seqscan=off
forces Postgres to use index scans.
The output of this query appears as follows:
Limit

1971

We've experimented with
lists
equal to 1000, 2000, and 4000, and
probes
equal to 1, 2, 10, 50, 100, 200.
Although there is a substantial gain in recall for increasing the number of
probes
, you will reach a point of diminishing returns when recall plateaus and execution time increases.
Therefore, we encourage experimenting with different values for
probes
and
lists
to achieve optimal search performance for your queries. Good places to start are:
Using a
lists
size equal to rows / 1000 for tables with up to 1 million rows, and
sqrt(rows)
for larger datasets.
Start with a
probes
value equal to lists / 10 for tables up to 1 million rows, and
sqrt(lists)
for larger datasets.
Conclusion
The sequential scan approach of
pgvector
performs well for small datasets but can be costly for larger ones. Use sequential scans if you require 100% accuracy, but expect performance issues with higher volumes of queries per second.
You can optimize searches using HNSW or IVFFlat indexes for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, but HNSW indexes have better query performance than IVFFlat with build time and memory usage tradeoffs.
Be sure to test different index tuning parameter settings to find the right balance between speed and accuracy for your specific use case and dataset.

<client_name>
with the name of your MCP client application. Supported client names include:
claude
for
Claude Desktop
cursor
for

If your MCP client is not listed here, you can manually add the Neon MCP Server details to your client's
mcp_config
file. The specific configuration varies slightly depending on your operating system.
MacOS/Linux
Windows
Windows (WSL)
For
MacOS and Linux
, add the following JSON configuration within the
mcpServers
section of your client's
mcp_config
file, replacing
<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>
with your actual Neon API key:
"neon"
: {
"command"
:
"npx"
,
"args"
:
[
"-y"
,
"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon"
,
"start"
,
"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"
]
}
Replace
<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>
with your Neon API key.
note
After successful configuration, you should see the Neon MCP Server listed as active in your MCP client's settings or tool list. You can enter "List my Neon projects" in the MCP client to see your Neon projects and verify the connection.
Troubleshooting
Configuration Issues
If your client does not use
JSON
for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:
# For Remote MCP server
npx
-y
mcp-remote
https://mcp.neon.tech/sse
# For Local MCP server
npx
-y
@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon
start
<
YOUR_NEON_API_KE
Y
>
OAuth Authentication Errors
When using the remote MCP server with OAuth authentication, you might encounter the following error:
{
"code"
:
"invalid_request"
,
"error"
:
"invalid redirect uri"
}
This typically occurs when there are issues with cached OAuth credentials. To resolve this:
Remove the MCP authentication cache directory:
rm
-rf
~/.mcp-auth
Restart your MCP client application
The OAuth flow will start fresh, allowing you to properly authenticate
This error is most common when using the remote MCP server option and can occur after OAuth configuration changes or when cached credentials become invalid.
Next steps
Once connected, you can start interacting with your Neon Postgres databases using natural language commands within your chosen MCP client. Explore the
Supported Actions (Tools)

Inngest
Quickly build AI RAG and Agentic workflows that scale with Inngest and Neon
Inngest is a popular framework for building AI RAG and Agentic workflows.
Inngest
provides automatic retries, caching along with concurrency and throttling management and AI requests offloading.
Inngest also integrates with Neon Postgres to trigger workflows based on database changes.
Build RAG with
step.run()
Inngest provides a
step.run()
API that allows you to compose your workflows into cacheable, retryable, and concurrency-safe steps:
In the above workflow, a network issue prevented the AI workflow to connect to the vector store. Fortunately, Inngest retries the failed step and uses the cached results from the previous steps, avoiding an unnecessary additional OpenAI call.
This workflow translates to the following code:
import
{ inngest }
from
'@/inngest'
;
import
{ getToolsForMessage
,
vectorSearch }
from
'@/helpers'
;
export
const
ragWorkflow
=
client
.createFunction
(
{ id
:
'rag-workflow'
,
concurrency
:
10
}
,
{ event
:
'chat.message'
}
,
async
({ event
,
step })
=>
{
const
{
message
}
=
event
.data;
const
page
=
await
step
.run
(
'tools.search'
,
async
()
=>
{
// Calls OpenAI
return
getToolsForMessage
(message);
});
await
step
.run
(
'vector-search'
,
async
()
=>
{
// Search in Neon's vector store
return
vectorSearch
(page);
});
// step 3 and 4...
}
);
Configuring
concurrency
or
throttling
to match your LLM provider's limits is achieved with a single line of code.
Learn more about using Inngest for RAG in the following article:
Multi-Tenant RAG With One Neon Project Per User
.
AI requests offloading:
step.ai.infer()
Inngest also provides a
step.ai.infer()
API that offloads AI requests.
By using
step.ai.infer()
your AI workflows will pause while waiting for the slow LLM response, avoiding unnecessary compute use on Serverless environments:
The previous RAG workflow can be rewritten to use
step.ai.infer()
to offload the AI request to the LLM provider:
import
{ inngest }
from
'@/inngest'
;
import
{ getPromptForToolsSearch
,
vectorSearch }
from
'@/helpers'
;
export
const
ragWorkflow
=
client
.createFunction
(
{ id
:
'rag-workflow'
,
concurrency
:
10
}
,
{ event
:
'chat.message'
}
,
async
({ event
,
step })
=>
{
const
{
message
}
=
event
.data;
const
prompt
=
getPromptForToolsSearch
(message);
await
step
.
ai
.infer
(
'tools.search'
,
{
model
:
openai
({ model
:
'gpt-4o'
})
,
body
:
{
messages
:
prompt
,
}
,
});
// other steps...
}
);
step.ai.infer()
, combined with Neon's Scale-to-zero feature, allows you to build AI workflows that scale costs with its success!

step.ai.infer()
in the following article:
step.ai: Build Serverless AI Applications That Won't Break the Bank
.
Trigger AI workflows based on database changes
Inngest also integrates with Neon Postgres to trigger AI workflows based on database changes:
This integration allows you to trigger AI workflows based on database changes, such as generating embeddings as soon as a new row is inserted into a table (see example below).
Configure the Inngests Neon integration to trigger AI workflows from your Neon database changes

LangChain
Build AI applications faster with LangChain and Postgres
LangChain is a popular framework for working with AI, Vectors, and embeddings. LangChain supports using Neon as a vector store, using the
pgvector
extension.
Initialize Postgres Vector Store
LangChain simplifies the complexity of managing document insertion and embeddings generation using vector stores by providing streamlined methods for these tasks.
Here's how you can initialize Postgres Vector with LangChain:
// File: vectorStore.ts
import
{ NeonPostgres }
from
'@langchain/community/vectorstores/neon'
;
import
{ OpenAIEmbeddings }
from
'@langchain/openai'
;
const
embeddings
=
new
OpenAIEmbeddings
({
dimensions
:
512
,
model
:
'text-embedding-3-small'
,
});
export
async

await
NeonPostgres
.initialize
(embeddings
,
{
connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
POSTGRES_URL
as
string
,
});
}
// Use in your code (say, in API routes)
const
vectorStore
=
await
loadVectorStore
();
Generate Embeddings with OpenAI
LangChain handles embedding generation internally while adding vectors to the Postgres database, simplifying the process for users. For more detailed control over embeddings, refer to the respective
JavaScript
and
Python
documentation.
Stream Chat Completions with OpenAI
LangChain can find similar documents to the user's latest query and invoke the OpenAI API to power
chat completion
responses, providing a seamless integration for creating dynamic interactions.
Here's how you can power chat completions in an API route:

Neon MCP Server
Manage your Neon Postgres databases using natural language commands with the Neon MCP Server.
The
Neon MCP Server
is an open-source tool that lets you interact with your Neon Postgres databases in
natural language
.
Imagine you want to create a new database. Instead of using the Neon Console or API, you could just type a request like, "Create a database named 'my-new-database'". Or, to see your projects, you might ask, "List all my Neon projects". The Neon MCP Server makes this possible.
It works by acting as a bridge between natural language requests and the
Neon API
. Built upon the
Model Context Protocol (MCP)
, it translates your requests into the necessary Neon API calls, allowing you to manage everything from creating projects and branches to running queries and performing database migrations.
Understanding MCP and Neon MCP Server
The
Model Context Protocol (MCP)
standardizes communication between LLMs and external tools. It defines a client-server architecture, enabling LLMs (Hosts) to connect to specialized servers that provide context and tools for interacting with external systems. The key components of the MCP architecture are:
Hosts
: These are AI applications, such as Claude Desktop or IDEs like Cursor, that initiate connections to MCP servers
Clients
: These reside within the host application and maintain one-to-one connections with individual MCP servers
Server
: These programs, such as Neon's MCP Server, provide context, tools, and prompts to clients, enabling access to external data and functionalities
Why use MCP?
Traditionally, connecting AI models to different data sources required developers to create custom code for each integration. This fragmented approach increased development time, maintenance burdens, and limited interoperability between AI models and tools. MCP addresses this challenge by providing a standardized protocol that simplifies integration, accelerates development, and enhances the capabilities of AI assistants.
What is Neon MCP server?
Neon MCP Server
acts as the
Server
in the MCP architecture, specifically designed for Neon. It provides a set of
tools
that MCP Clients (like Claude Desktop, Cursor) can utilize to manage Neon resources. This includes actions for project management, branch management, executing SQL queries, and handling database migrations, all driven by natural language requests.
Key Benefits of using Neon MCP Server:
Natural language interaction:
Manage Neon databases using intuitive, conversational commands.
Simplified database management:
Perform complex actions without writing SQL or directly using the Neon API.
Enhanced Productivity:
Streamline workflows for database administration and development.
Accessibility for non-developers:
Empower users with varying technical backgrounds to interact with Neon databases.
Database migration support:
Leverage Neon's branching capabilities for database schema changes initiated via natural language.
Security Considerations
The Neon MCP server grants powerful database management capabilities through natural language requests.
Always review and authorize actions
requested by the LLM before execution. Ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the Neon MCP server and Neon API keys.
Setup options
You can set up the Neon MCP Server in two ways:
Remote hosted server (preview)
You can use Neon's managed MCP server, available at
https://mcp.neon.tech
. This is the
easiest
way to start using the Neon MCP Server. It streamlines the setup process by utilizing OAuth for authentication, eliminating the need to manage Neon API keys directly in your client configuration.
note
The remote hosted MCP server is currently in its preview phase. As the
OAuth specification for MCP
is still quite new, we are releasing it in this preview state. During the initial weeks, you may experience some adjustments to the setup. However, the instructions provided should be straightforward to follow at this time.
Prerequisites:
An MCP Client application (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Cline, Zed).
A Neon account.
Setup steps:
Go to your MCP Client's settings where you configure MCP Servers (this varies by client)
Register a new MCP Server. Add a configuration block for "Neon" under 'mcpServers' key. The configuration should look like this:
{
"mcpServers"
:
{
"Neon"
:
{
"command"
:
"npx"
,
"args"
:
[
"-y"
,
"mcp-remote"
,
"https://mcp.neon.tech/sse"
]
}
}
}
This command uses
npx
to run a
small helper (
mcp-remote
)
that connects to Neon's hosted server endpoint (
https://mcp.neon.tech/sse
).
Save the configuration and
restart or refresh
your MCP client application.
The first time the client initializes Neon's MCP server, it should trigger an
OAuth flow
:
Your browser will open a Neon page asking you to authorize the "Neon MCP Server" to access your Neon account.
Review the requested permissions and click
Authorize
.
You should see a success message, and you can close the browser tab.
Your MCP client should now be connected to the Neon Remote MCP Server and ready to use.
Local MCP Server
You can install Neon MCP server locally using
npm
or
smithey
.
Prerequisites
Node.js (>= v18.0.0):
Ensure Node.js version 18 or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from
nodejs.org
.
Neon API Key:
You will need a Neon API key to authenticate the Neon MCP Server with your Neon account. You can create one from the
Neon Console
under your Profile settings. Refer to the
Neon documentation on API Keys
for detailed instructions.
note
We recommend using Smithery for installation, as it streamlines the process and guarantees compatibility across MCP clients.
Installation via Smithery - MCP Registry
Smithery
provides a streamlined method for installing MCP servers.
Open your terminal.
Run the Smithery installation command:
npx
-y
@smithery/cli
install
neon
--client
<
client_nam
e
>
Replace
<client_name>
with the name of your MCP client application. Supported client names include:
claude
for
Claude Desktop
cursor
for
Cursor
(Installing via
smithery
makes the MCP server a global MCP server in Cursor)
windsurf
for
Windsurf Editor
roo-cline
for
Roo Cline VS Code extension
witsy
for
Witsy
enconvo
for
Enconvo
vscode
for
Visual Studio Code (Preview)
For example, to install for Claude Desktop, use:
npx
-y
@smithery/cli
install
neon
--client
claude
You will be then prompted to enter the Neon API key.
✔ Successfully resolved neon

? The API key for accessing the Neon. You can generate one through the Neon console. (required)
*********************************************************************
neon successfully installed for claude
Restart your MCP Client application. For example, if you are using Claude Desktop, quit and reopen the application.
Installation via npm
Open your MCP client application and navigate to the settings where you can configure MCP servers. The location of these settings may vary depending on your client. Add a configuration block for "Neon" under the
mcpServers
key. Your configuration should look like this:
{
"mcpServers"
:
{
"neon"
:
{
"command"
:
"npx"
,
"args"
:
[
"-y"
,
"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon"
,
"start"
,
"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"
]
}
}
}
note
If you are using Windows and encounter issues while adding the MCP server, you might need to use the Command Prompt (
cmd
) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (
wsl
) to run the necessary commands. Your configuration setup may resemble the following:
Windows
Windows (WSL)
{
"mcpServers"
:
{
"neon"
:
{
"command"
:
"cmd"
,
"args"
:
[
"/c"
,
"npx"
,
"-y"
,
"@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon"
,
"start"
,
"<YOUR_NEON_API_KEY>"
]
}
}
}
Troubleshooting
If your client does not use
JSON
for configuration of MCP servers (such as older versions of Cursor), you can use the following command when prompted:
npx
-y
@neondatabase/mcp-server-neon
start
<
YOUR_NEON_API_KE
Y
>
Supported actions (tools)
The Neon MCP Server provides the following actions, which are exposed as "tools" to MCP Clients. You can use these tools to interact with your Neon projects and databases using natural language commands.
Project management:
list_projects

Usage examples
After setting up either the remote or local server and connecting your MCP client, you can start interacting with your Neon databases using natural language.
Example interactions
List projects:
"List my Neon projects"
Create a new project:
"Create a Neon project named 'my-test-project'"
List tables in a database:
"What tables are in the database 'my-database' in project 'my-project'?"
Add a column to a table:
"Add a column 'email' of type VARCHAR to the 'users' table in database 'main' of project 'my-project'"
Run a query:
"Show me the first 10 rows from the 'users' table in database 'my-database'"
You can also refer to our individual guides for detailed examples on using the Neon MCP Server with specific MCP clients:

Semantic Kernel
Quickly build AI RAG and Agentic workflows with Semantic Kernel and Neon
Semantic Kernel
is an open-source SDK developed by Microsoft that enables the integration of large language models (LLMs) with traditional programming constructs. It allows developers to build AI-powered applications by combining natural language processing, planning, and memory capabilities. Semantic Kernel supports orchestration of AI workflows, plugin-based extensibility, and vector-based memory storage for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) use cases. It is commonly used to create intelligent agents, chatbots, and automation tools that leverage LLMs like OpenAI’s GPT models.
Initialize Postgres Vector Store
Semantic Kernel supports using Neon as a vector store, using its the
pgvector
extension and existing
Postgres Vector Store connector
to access and manage data in Neon. It establishes a Neon connection, enables vector support, and initializes a vector store for AI-driven search and retrieval tasks
Here's how you can initialize Postgres Vector Store with Semantic Kernel in .NET using
Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Connectors.Postgres
NuGet package:
// File: Program.cs

app.build
We're very happy to join the codegen community with
app.build
, our open-source reference implementation for building codegen products on top of Neon. app.build is an agent that converts AI-generated code snippets into complete, deployed applications. While LLMs handle isolated coding problems well, app.build uses agent architecture to create production-ready apps.
Why we built this:
Beyond code snippets
- Transforms prompts into complete, deployed applications with frontend, backend, and database
Community-driven development
- Open source for developers to bring their own models and run locally
True agent architecture
- Iterates on code, runs tests, and responds to feedback until everything works
Instant deployment
- Ships working apps with real infrastructure
Getting started:
npx
@app.build/cli
With this single command, you can create and deploy a complete application with its own GitHub repository.
How it works:
The agent decomposes app creation into validated tasks, running checks at each step to ensure everything works. This divide-and-conquer approach enables reliable generation of complex applications beyond simple code snippets.
Join us:
GitHub
- Built in the open for developers exploring AI-powered development.

Netlify DB documentation
.
Add domains to Neon Auth
You can now whitelist redirect URIs for your deployed app directly in Neon Auth, without needing to create a Stack Auth account or transfer your project. This makes it easier to manage your app's authentication settings and simplifies your workflow.
Fixes & improvements
Neon Console
We updated the warning message to clarify that changing compute size settings will definitely interrupt database connections, rather than just possibly doing so. We want to make that clear so you know exactly what to expect.
Every new user now starts with their own free organization, simplifying our
object hierarchy
and improving development velocity.
Neon serverless driver
The Neon serverless driver was updated to version 1.0.1. This release includes package updates and addresses a few other issues:
The package now prints a security warning to the console when a connection is made in a web browser. This behavior can be suppressed with a new configuration option:
disableWarningInBrowsers
.
escapeIdentifier
is now re-exported from
pg
, resolving
#154
.
Fixes a module resolution issue in the Deno/JSR version of the driver by correcting the
@types/pg
version reference, resolving
#112
.
Neon API
We've added new API endpoints to help you manage your Neon Auth domains:
list domains
,
add a domain
, and
delete a domain
. These endpoints make it easy to manage your redirect URIs programmatically.
Neon CLI
Version 2.10.0: prompts for organization selection if needed, with an option to save as default.
Fixes
Fixed an issue with IPv6 validation, ensuring that compressed IPv6 formats are properly validated. This improves stability and correctness for users relying on IPv6 functionality.

Choosing your driver and connection type
How to select the right driver and connection type for your application
When setting up your application’s connection to your Neon Postgres database, you need to make two main choices:
The right driver for your deployment
— Neon Serverless driver or a TCP-based driver
The right connection type for your traffic
— pooled connections or direct connections
This flowchart will guide you through these selections.
Choosing your connection type: flowchart
Choosing your connection type: drivers and pooling
Your first choice is which driver to use
Serverless
If working in a serverless environment and connecting from a JavaScript or TypeScript application, we recommend using the
Neon Serverless Driver
. It handles dynamic workloads with high variability in traffic — for example, Vercel Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers.
TCP-based driver
If you're not connecting from a JavaScript or TypeScript application or you are not developing a serverless application, use a traditional TCP-based Postgres driver. For example, if you’re using Node.js with a framework like Next.js, you can add the
pg
client to your dependencies, which serves as the Postgres driver for TCP connections.
HTTP or WebSockets
If you are using the serverless driver, you also need to choose whether to query over HTTP or WebSockets:
HTTP
Querying over an HTTP
fetch
request is faster for single, non-interactive transactions, also referred to as "one-shot queries". Issuing
multiple queries
via a single, non-interactive transaction is also supported. See
Use the driver over HTTP
.
WebSockets
If you require session or interactive transaction support or compatibility with
node-postgres
(the popular
npm
pg
package), use WebSockets. See
Use the driver over WebSockets
.
Next, choose your connection type: direct or pooled
You then need to decide whether to use direct connections or pooled connections (using PgBouncer for Neon-side pooling):
In general, use pooled connections whenever you can
Pooled connections can efficiently manage high numbers of concurrent client connections, up to 10,000. This 10K ceiling works best for serverless applications and Neon-side connection pools that have many open connections, but infrequent and/or short transactions.
Use direct (unpooled) connections if you need persistent connections
If your application is focused mainly on tasks like migrations or administrative operations that require stable and long-lived connections, use an unpooled connection.
note
PgBouncer can keep many application connections open (up to 10,000) concurrently, but only a certain number of these can be actively querying the Postgres server at any given time. This number is defined by the PgBouncer
default_pool_size
setting. See
Neon PgBouncer configuration settings
for details.
For more information on these choices, see:
Neon Serverless Driver
Connection pooling
Common Pitfalls
Here are some key points to help you navigate potential issues.
Issue
Description
Double pooling
Neon-side pooling
uses PgBouncer to manage connections between your application and Postgres.
Client-side pooling
occurs within the client library before connections are passed to PgBouncer.
If you're using a pooled Neon connection (supported by PgBouncer), it's best to avoid client-side pooling. Let Neon handle the pooling to prevent retaining unused connections on the client side. If you must use client-side pooling, make sure that connections are released back to the pool promptly to avoid conflicts with PgBouncer.
Understanding limits
Don't confuse
max_connections
with
default_pool_size
.
max_connections
is the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed by Postgres, determined by your
Neon compute size configuration
.
default_pool_size
is the maximum number of backend connections or transactions that PgBouncer supports per user/database pair, also determined by compute size
Simply increasing your compute to get more
max_connections
may not improve performance if the bottleneck is actually on your
default_pool_size
. To increase your
default_pool_size
, contact
Support
.
Use request handlers
In serverless environments such as Vercel Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers, WebSocket connections can't outlive a single request. That means Pool or Client objects must be connected, used and closed within a single request handler. Don't create them outside a request handler; don't create them in one handler and try to reuse them in another; and to avoid exhausting available connections, don't forget to close them. See
Pool and Client
for details.
Configuration
Installing the Neon Serverless Driver
You can install the driver with your preferred JavaScript package manager. For example:
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Find details on configuring the Neon Serverless Driver for querying over HTTP or WebSockets here:
Use the driver over HTTP
Use the driver over WebSockets
Installing traditional TCP-based drivers
You can use standard Postgres client libraries or drivers. Neon is fully compatible with Postgres, so any application or utility that works with Postgres should work with Neon. Consult the integration guide for your particular language or framework for the right client for your needs:
Framework Quickstarts
Language Quickstarts
Configuring the connection
Setting up a direct or pooled connection is usually a matter of choosing the appropriate connection string and adding it to your application's
.env
file.
You can get your connection string from the
Neon Console
or via CLI.
For example, to get a pooled connection string via CLI:
neon
connection-string
--pooled
true
[branch_name]
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Notice the
-pooler
in the connection string — that's what differentiates a direct connection string from a pooled one.
Here's an example of getting a direct connection string from the Neon CLI:
neon
connection-string
[branch_name]
postgres://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
For more details, see
How to use connection pooling
.

Database connection details
When connecting to Neon from an application or client, you connect to a database in your Neon project. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch, which may be the default branch of your project (
production
) or a child branch.
You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. This opens the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a compute, a database, and a role. A connection string is constructed for you.
Neon supports both pooled and direct connections to your database. Neon's connection pooler supports a higher number of concurrent connections, so we provide pooled connection details in the
Connect to your database
modal by default, which adds a
-pooler
option to your connection string. If needed, you can get direct database connection details from the modal disabling the
Connection pooling
toggle. For more information about pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
A Neon connection string includes the role, password, hostname, and database name.
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
^    ^         ^                         ^                              ^
role -|    |         |- hostname               |- pooler option               |- database
|
|- password
note
The hostname includes the ID of the compute, which has an
ep-
prefix:
ep-cool-darkness-123456
. For more information about Neon connection strings, see
connection string
.
You can use the details from the
Connect to your database
modal to configure your database connection. For example, you might place the connection details in an
.env
file, assign the connection string to a variable, or pass the connection string on the command-line.
.env file
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGUSER=alex
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
Variable
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
Command-line
psql
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
note
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption, but you can increase the level of protection by configuring the
sslmode
option. For more information, see
Connect to Neon securely
.
Where can I find my password?
It's included in your Neon connection string. Click the
Connection
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Save your connection details to 1Password
If have a
1Password
browser extension, you can save your database connection details to 1Password directly from the Neon Console. In your
Project Dashboard
, click
Connect
, then click
Save in 1Password
.
What port does Neon use?
Neon uses the default Postgres port,
5432
.
Connection examples
The
Connect to your database
modal provides connection examples for different frameworks and languages, constructed for the branch, database, and role that you select.

Network protocol support
Neon projects provisioned on AWS support both
IPv4
and
IPv6
addresses. Neon projects provisioned on Azure support IPv4.
Additionally, Neon provides a low-latency serverless driver that supports connections over WebSockets and HTTP. Great for serverless or edge environments where connections over TCP may not be not supported. For further information, refer to our
Neon serverless driver
documentation.
Connection notes
Some older Postgres client libraries and drivers, including older
psql
executables, are built without
Server Name Indication (SNI)
support, which means that a connection workaround may be required. For more information, see
Connection errors: The endpoint ID is not specified
.
Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI when configuring a connection to Neon. For examples, see
Connect a GUI or IDE
.
When connecting from BI tools like Metabase, Tableau, or Power BI, we recommend using a
read replica
instead of your main database compute. BI tools often run long or resource-intensive queries, which can impact performance on your primary branch. Read replicas can scale independently and handle these workloads without affecting your main production traffic. To learn more, see
Neon read replicas

Connect a GUI application
Learn how to connect a GUI application to Neon
This topic describes how to connect to a Neon database from a GUI application or IDE. Most GUI applications and IDEs that support connecting to a Postgres database also support connecting to Neon.
Gather your connection details
The following details are typically required when configuring a connection:
hostname
port
database name
role (user)
password
You can gather these details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
note
Neon supports pooled and direct connections to the database. Use a pooled connection string if your application uses a high number of concurrent connections. For more information, see
Connection pooling
.
The connection string includes the role, password, hostname, and database name.
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
^              ^                                               ^

role name:
alex
hostname:
ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
database name:
dbname
Neon uses the default Postgres port,
5432
.
Connect to the database
In the GUI application or IDE, enter the connection details into the appropriate fields and connect. Some applications permit specifying a connection string while others require entering connection details into separate fields. In the pgAdmin example below, connection details are entered into separate fields, and clicking
Save
establishes the database connection.
Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI when configuring a connection to Neon. For example, the DBeaver client has a
URL
field, but connecting to Neon requires specifying the connection details as shown:
Tested GUI applications and IDEs
Connections from the GUI applications and IDEs in the table below have been tested with Neon.
note
Some applications require an Server Name Indication (SNI) workaround. Neon uses compute domain names to route incoming connections. However, the Postgres wire protocol does not transfer the server domain name, so Neon relies on the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to do this. Not all application clients support SNI. In these cases, a workaround is required. For more information, see
Connection errors

Connect to Neon securely
Learn how to connect to Neon securely when using a connection string
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties. Neon rejects connections that do not use SSL/TLS, behaving in the same way as standalone Postgres with only
hostssl
records in a
pg_hba.conf
configuration file.
However, there are different levels of protection when using SSL/TLS encryption, which you can configure by appending an
sslmode
parameter to your connection string.
Connection modes
When connecting to Neon or any Postgres database, the
sslmode
parameter setting determines the security of the connection. You can append the
sslmode
parameter to your Neon connection string as shown:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=verify-full
Neon supports the following
sslmode
settings, in order of least to most secure.
sslmode
Description
require
Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is verified. If verification fails, the connection is refused.
verify-ca
Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is verified. In addition, the client verifies that the server's certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
verify-full
Encryption is required and the server's SSL/TLS certificate is fully verified, including hostname verification, expiration checks, and revocation checks. In addition, the client verifies that the server's certificate has been signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
The choice of which mode to use depends on the specific security requirements of the application and the level of risk that you are willing to tolerate. Neon recommends that you always use
verify-full
mode, which ensures the highest level of security and protects against a wide range of attacks including man-in-the-middle attacks. The following sections describe how to configure connections using
verify-full
mode.
The required configuration for your connection depends on the client you are using.
Connect from the psql client
To connect from the
psql
command-line client with
sslmode=verify-full
, provide the path to your system root certificates by setting the
PGSSLROOTCERT
variable to the location of your operating system's root certificates. You can set this environment variable in your shell, typically bash or similar, using the export command. For example, if your root certificate is at
/path/to/root.crt
, you would set the variable like so:
export
PGSSLROOTCERT
=
"/path/to/your/root.crt"
Refer to
Location of system root certificates
below to find the path to system root certificates for your operating system.
Connect from other clients
If the client application uses a popular Postgres client library, such as
psycopg2
for Python or JDBC for Java, the library typically provides built-in support for SSL/TLS encryption and verification, allowing you to configure an
sslmode
setting in the connection parameters. For example:
import
psycopg2
conn
=
psycopg2
.
connect
(
dbname
=
'dbname'
,
user
=
'alex'
,
password
=
'AbC123dEf'
,
host
=
'ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech'
,
port
=
'5432'
,
sslmode
=
'verify-full'
,
sslrootcert
=
'/path/to/your/root.crt'
)
However, if your client application uses a non-standard Postgres client, SSL/TLS may not be enabled by default. In this case, you must manually configure the client to use SSL/TLS and specify an
sslmode
configuration. Refer to the client or the client's driver documentation for how to configure the path to your operating system's root certificates.
Location of system root certificates
Neon uses the public ISRG Root X1 certificate issued by
Let’s Encrypt
. You can find the PEM-encoded certificate here:
isrgrootx1.pem
. Typically, you do not need to download this file directly, as it is usually available in a root store on your operating system. A root store is a collection of pre-downloaded root certificates from various Certificate Authorities (CAs). These are highly trusted CAs, and their certificates are typically shipped with operating systems and some applications.
The location of the root store varies by operating system or distribution. Here are some locations where you might find the required root certificates on popular operating systems:
Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, etc.
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
CentOS, Fedora, RedHat
/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
OpenSUSE
/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
Alpine Linux
/etc/ssl/cert.pem
Android
/system/etc/security/cacerts
macOS:
/etc/ssl/cert.pem
Windows
Windows does not provide a file containing the CA roots that can be used by your driver. However, many popular programming languages used on Windows like C#, Java, or Go do not require the CA root path to be specified and will use the Windows internal system roots by default.
However, if you are using a language that requires specifying the CA root path, such as C or PHP, you can obtain a bundle of root certificates from the Mozilla CA Certificate program provided by the Curl project. You can download the bundle at
https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html
. After downloading the file, you will need to configure your driver to point to the bundle.
The system root certificate locations listed above may differ depending on the version, distribution, and configuration of your operating system. If you do not find the root certificates in these locations, refer to your operating system documentation.

Connection errors
Learn how to resolve connection errors
This topic describes how to resolve connection errors you may encounter when using Neon. The errors covered include:
The endpoint ID is not specified
Password authentication failed for user
Couldn't connect to compute node
Can't reach database server
Error undefined: Database error
Terminating connection due to administrator command
Unsupported startup parameter
You have exceeded the limit of concurrently active endpoints
Remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
Relation not found
Postgrex: DBConnection ConnectionError ssl send: closed

Terminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout
DNS resolution issues
info
Connection problems are sometimes related to a system issue. To check for system issues, please refer to the
Neon status page
.
The endpoint ID is not specified
With older clients and some native Postgres clients, you may receive the following error when attempting to connect to Neon:
ERROR:
The
endpoint
ID
is
not
specified.
Either
upgrade
the
Postgres
client
library
(libpq)
for
SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (
the
first
part
of
the
domain
name
) as a parameter:
'&options=endpoint%3D'
. See [https://neon.com/sni](
/sni
) for more information.
This error occurs if your client library or application does not support the
Server Name Indication (SNI)
mechanism in TLS.
Neon uses compute IDs (the first part of a Neon domain name) to route incoming connections. However, the Postgres wire protocol does not transfer domain name information, so Neon relies on the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol to do this.
SNI support was added to
libpq
(the official Postgres client library) in Postgres 14, which was released in September 2021. Clients that use your system's
libpq
library should work if your Postgres version is >= 14. On Linux and macOS, you can check Postgres version by running
pg_config --version
. On Windows, check the
libpq.dll
version in your Postgres installation's
bin
directory. Right-click on the file, select
Properties
>
Details
.
If a library or application upgrade does not help, there are several workarounds, described below, for providing the required domain name information when connecting to Neon.
A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option
Neon supports a connection option named
endpoint
, which you can use to identify the compute you are connecting to. Specifically, you can add
options=endpoint%3D[endpoint_id]
as a parameter to your connection string, as shown in the example below. The
%3D
is a URL-encoded
=
sign. Replace
[endpoint_id]
with your compute's ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this:
ep-cool-darkness-123456
.
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?options
=endpoint%3D[endpoint-id]
note
The
endpoint
connection option was previously named
project
. The
project
option is deprecated but remains supported for backward compatibility.
The
endpoint
option works if your application or library permits it to be set. Not all of them do, especially in the case of GUI applications.
B. Use libpq key=value syntax in the database field
If your application or client is based on
libpq
but you cannot upgrade the library, such as when the library is compiled inside of a an application, you can take advantage of the fact that
libpq
permits adding options to the database name. So, in addition to the database name, you can specify the
endpoint
option, as shown below. Replace
[endpoint_id]
with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this:
ep-cool-darkness-123456
.
dbname
=
neondb
options
=
endpoint
=
[endpoint_id
]
C. Set verify-full for golang-based clients
If your application or service uses golang Postgres clients like
pgx
and
lib/pg
, you can set
sslmode=verify-full
, which causes SNI information to be sent when you connect. Most likely, this behavior is not intended but happens inadvertently due to the golang's TLS library API design.
D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field
Another supported workaround involves specifying the endpoint ID in the password field. So, instead of specifying only your password, you provide a string consisting of the
endpoint
option and your password, separated by a semicolon (
;
) or dollar sign character (
$
), as shown in the examples below. Replace
[endpoint_id]
with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this:
ep-cool-darkness-123456
.
endpoint
=<
endpoint_id
>
;
<
password
>
or
endpoint
=<
endpoint_id
>
$
<
password
>
Example:
postgresql://alex:endpoint
=ep-cool-darkness-123456
;
AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
note
Using a dollar sign (
$
) character as a separator may be required if a semicolon (
;
) is not a permitted character in a password field. For example, the
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)
does not permit a semicolon character in the
Password
field when defining connection details for database endpoints.
This approach causes the authentication method to be downgraded from
scram-sha-256
(never transfers a plain text password) to
password
(transfers a plain text password). However, the connection is still TLS-encrypted, so the level of security is equivalent to the security provided by
https
websites as long as
sslmode=verify-full
or channel binding is used. We intend deprecate this option when most libraries and applications provide SNI support.
Libraries
Clients on the
list of drivers
on the PostgreSQL community wiki that use your system's

Password authentication failed for user
The following error is often the result of an incorrectly defined connection information, or the driver you are using does not support Server Name Indication (SNI).
ERROR:  password authentication failed for user '<user_name>' connection to server at "ep-billowing-fun-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech" (12.345.67.89), port 5432 failed: ERROR:  connection is insecure (try using `sslmode=require`)
Check your connection to see if it is defined correctly. Your Neon connection string can be obtained by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It appears similar to this:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]

Couldn't connect to compute node
This error arises when the Neon proxy, which accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol, fails to establish a connection with your compute. This issue sometimes occurs due to repeated connection attempts during the compute's restart phase after it has been idle due to
scale to zero
. The transition from an idle to an active state only takes a few hundred milliseconds.
Consider these recommended steps:
Visit the
Neon status page
to ensure there are no ongoing issues.
Pause for a short period to allow your compute to restart, then try reconnecting.
Try
connecting with psql
to see if a connection can be established.
Review the strategies in
Connection latency and timeouts
for avoiding connection issues due to compute startup time.
If the connection issue persists, please reach out to
Support
.
Can't reach database server
This error is sometimes encountered when using Prisma Client with Neon.
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
A compute in Neon has two main states:
Active
and
Idle
. Active means that Postgres is currently running. If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, the activity monitor gracefully places the compute into an idle state to reduce compute usage.
When you connect to an idle compute, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds. If the error above is reported, it most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before your Neon compute was activated. For dealing with this connection timeout scenario, refer to the
connection timeout
instructions in our Prisma documentation. Our
connection latency and timeout
documentation may also be useful in addressing this issue.
Error undefined: Database error
This error is sometimes encountered when using Prisma Migrate with Neon.
Error undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement
"s0" already exists
Prisma Migrate requires a direct connection to the database. It does not support a pooled connection with PgBouncer, which is the connection pooler used by Neon. Attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands, such as
prisma migrate dev
, with a pooled connection causes this error. To resolve this issue, please refer to our
Connection pooling with Prisma Migrate
instructions.
Terminating connection due to administrator command
The
terminating connection due to administrator command
error is typically encountered when running a query from a connection that has sat idle long enough for the compute to suspend due to inactivity. Neon automatically suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity, by default. You can reproduce this error by connecting to your database from an application or client such as
psql
, letting the connection remain idle until the compute suspends, and then running a query from the same connection.
If you encounter this error, you can try adjusting the timing of your query or reestablishing the connection before running the query. Alternatively, if you are a paying user, you can disable scale to zero. For instructions, see
Configuring Scale to zero for Neon computes
.
Neon Free Plan
users cannot disable scale to zero.
Unsupported startup parameter
This error is reported in two variations:
unsupported startup parameter: <...>
unsupported startup parameter in options: <...>
The error occurs when using a pooled Neon connection string with startup options that are not supported by PgBouncer. PgBouncer allows only startup parameters it can keep track of in startup packets. These include:
client_encoding
,
datestyle
,
timezone
,
standard_conforming_strings
, and
application_name
. See
track_extra_parameters
, in the
PgBouncer documentation
. To resolve this error, you can either remove the unsupported parameter from your connection string or use an unpooled Neon connection string. For information about pooled and unpooled connections in Neon, see
Connection pooling
.
You have exceeded the limit of concurrently active endpoints
This error can also appear as:
active endpoints limit exceeded
.
Neon has a default limit of 20 concurrently active computes to protect your account from unintended usage. The compute associated with the default branch is exempt from this limit, ensuring that it is always available. When you exceed the limit, any compute associated with a non-default branch will remain suspended and you will see this error when attempting to connect to it. You can suspend computes and try again. Alternatively, if you encounter this error often, you can reach out to
Support
to request a limit increase.
Remaining connection slots are reserved for roles with the SUPERUSER attribute
This error occurs when the maximum number of simultaneous database connections, defined by the Postgres
max_connections
setting, is reached.
To resolve this issue, you have several options:
Find and remove long-running or idle connections. See
Find long-running or idle connections
.
Use a larger compute, with a higher
max_connections
configuration. See
How to size your compute
.
Enable
connection pooling
.
If you are already using connection pooling, you may need to reach out to Neon Support to request a higher
default_pool_size
setting for PgBouncer. See
Neon PgBouncer configuration settings for more information
.
Relation not found
This error is often encountered when attempting to set the Postgres
search_path
session variable using a
SET search_path
statement over a pooled connection. For more information and workarounds, please see
Connection pooling in transaction mode
.
Postgrex: DBConnection ConnectionError ssl send: closed
Postgrex has an
:idle_interval
connection parameter that defines an interval for pinging connections after a period of inactivity. The default setting is
1000ms
. If you rely on Neon's
autosuspend
feature to scale your compute to zero when your database is not active, this setting will prevent that and you may encounter a
(DBConnection.ConnectionError) ssl send: closed (ecto_sql 3.12.0)
error as a result. As a workaround, you can set the interval to a higher value to allow your Neon compute to suspend. For example:
config :app_name
,
AppName
.
Repo
# normal connection options
..
.
idle_interval:
:timer
.
hours
(
24
)
For additional details, refer to this discussion on our Discord server:
Compute not suspended due to Postgrex idle_interval setting
query_wait_timeout SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly
The
query_wait_timeout
setting is a PgBouncer configuration option that determines the maximum time a query can wait in the queue before being executed. Neon’s default value for this setting is
120 seconds
. If a query exceeds this timeout while in the queue, it will not be executed. For more details about this setting, refer to
Neon PgBouncer configuration settings
.
To avoid this error, we recommend reviewing your workload. If it includes batch processing with
UPDATE
or
INSERT
statements, review their performance. Slow queries may be the root cause. Try optimizing these queries to reduce execution time, which can help prevent them from exceeding the timeout.
Alternatively, Neon can increase the
query_wait_timeout
value for you, but this is not typically recommended, as increasing the timeout can lead to higher latency or blocked queries under heavy workloads.
The request could not be authorized due to an internal error
This error page in the Neon Console is most often the result of attempting to access a Neon project in one browser window after you've have logged in under a different Neon user account from another browser window. The error occurs because the currently logged in Neon user account does not have access to the Neon project. To avoid this issue, ensure that you're logged in with a Neon user account that has access to the Neon project you're trying to access.
Terminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout
This error occurs when a session remains idle within an open transaction for longer than the specified timeout period. By default, the
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout
setting is set to
5min
(300,000 milliseconds). This timeout helps prevent idle sessions from holding locks or contributing to table bloat.
If you encounter this error, you can adjust the
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout
setting to a higher value or disable it entirely by setting it to
0
. Below are ways to change this setting:
Change at the session level:
SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0;
Change at the database level:
ALTER DATABASE <dbname> SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0;
(replace
<dbname>
with the name of your database)
Change at the role level:
ALTER ROLE <role> SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0;
(replace
<role>
with the name of the user role)
Be aware that leaving transactions idle for extended periods can prevent vacuuming and increase the number of open connections. Please use caution and consider only changing the value temporarily, as needed.
DNS resolution issues
Some users encounter DNS resolution failures when connecting to their Neon database. These issues are often reported when using the
Tables
page in the Neon Console. In such cases, users may see an
Unexpected error happened
message like the one below:
To check for a DNS resolution issue, you can run
nslookup
on your Neon hostname, which is the part of your Neon database
connection string
starting with your endpoint ID (e.g.,
ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4
) and ending with
neon.tech
. For example:
nslookup
ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
If the Neon hostname resolves correctly, you'll see output similar to this:
nslookup
ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
Server:
192.168.2.1
Address:
192.168.2.1#53
Non-authoritative
answer:
p-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
canonical
name
=
ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech.
Name:
ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
Address:
203.0.113.10
Name:
ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
Address:
203.0.113.20
Name:
ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
Address:
203.0.113.30
If the hostname does not resolve, you might see an error like this, where the DNS query is refused:
**
server can
't find ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech: REFUSED
To verify that it's a DNS resolution issue, run the following test using a public DNS resolver, such as Google DNS:
nslookup
ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech
8.8.8.8
If this succeeds, it's very likely a DNS resolution issue.
Cause
Failure to resolve the Neon hostname can happen for different reasons:
Regional DNS caching or propagation delays
Restrictive or misconfigured DNS resolvers (such as those provided by your ISP)
System-wide web proxy settings that interfere with DNS resolution
Workarounds
Using a Public DNS Resolver
Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1
These can be changed at:
OS level (macOS, Windows, Linux)
Router level
Mobile device network settings
Android Private DNS (configure a trusted provider such as
dns.google
or
1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com
)
To change your DNS configuration at the OS level:
macOS
: System Settings → Network → Wi-Fi → Details → DNS
Windows
: Control Panel → Network and Internet → Network Connections → Right-click your connection → Properties → Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)
Linux
: Edit
/etc/resolv.conf
or configure your network manager (e.g., NetworkManager, Netplan)
This article provides detailed instructions:
How to Turn on Private DNS Mode
Disable system-wide web proxies
If you’re using a proxy configured at the OS level, it may interfere with DNS lookups. To check and disable system proxy settings:
macOS
: System Settings → Network → Wi-Fi → Details → Proxies. Uncheck any active proxy options (e.g., "Web Proxy (HTTP)", "Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)")
Windows
: Settings → Network & Internet → Proxy. Turn off "Use a proxy server" if it's enabled
Linux
: Check your environment variables (e.g.,
http_proxy
,
https_proxy
) and system settings under Network/Proxy.
Using a VPN
Using a VPN routes DNS queries through a different resolver and often bypasses the issue entirely.

Connection latency and timeouts
Learn about strategies to manage connection latencies and timeouts
Neon's
Scale to zero
feature is designed to minimize costs by automatically scaling a compute resource down to zero after a period of inactivity. By default, Neon scales a compute to zero after 5 minutes of inactivity. A characteristic of this feature is the concept of a "cold start". During this process, a compute transitions from an idle state to an active state to process requests. Currently, activating a Neon compute from an idle state typically takes a few hundred milliseconds not counting other factors that can add to latencies such as the physical distance between your application and database or startup times of other services that participate in your connection process.
note
Services you integrate with Neon may also have startup times, which can add to connection latencies. This topic does not address latencies of other vendors, but if your application connects to Neon via another service, remember to consider startup times for those services as well.
Check the status of a compute
You can check the current status of a compute on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console. A compute will report either an
Active
or
Idle
status.
You can also view compute state transitions in the
Branches
widget on the Neon
Dashboard
.
User actions that activate an idle compute include connecting from a client or application, running a query on your database from the
Neon SQL Editor
, or accessing the compute via the
Neon API
.
info
The Neon API includes
Start endpoint
and
Suspend endpoint
APIs for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.
You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it changes from an
Idle
to an
Active
state. By default, a compute is suspended after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity. Users on paid plans can configure this delay period, which is described later in this topic.
Strategies for managing latency and timeouts
Given the potential impact on application responsiveness, it's important to have strategies in place to manage connection latencies and timeouts. Here are some methods you can implement:
Adjust your Scale to zero configuration
Place your application and database in the same region
Increase your connection timeout
Build connection timeout handling into your application
Use application-level caching
Adjust your scale to zero configuration
Users on paid plans can configure the length of time that the system remains in an inactive state before Neon scales your compute down to zero. This lets you set the balance between performance (never scaling down) and cost (scaling to zero at reasonable intervals). The scale to zero setting is set to 5 minutes by default. You can set a custom period of up to a maximum of 7 days, or disable scale to zero entirely. To disable scale to zero, see
Edit a compute
.
important
If you disable scale to zero entirely or your compute is never idle long enough to be automatically suspended, you will have to manually restart your compute to pick up the latest updates to Neon's compute images. Neon typically releases compute-related updates weekly. Not all releases contain critical updates, but a weekly compute restart is recommended to ensure that you do not miss anything important. For how to restart a compute, see
Restart a compute
.
To configure a custom scale to zero setting, modify
suspend_timeout_seconds
using the
Update compute endpoint API
API, as shown below. To use this API, you need to specify your project ID and compute endpoint ID. You can find your project ID in your project's settings. You can find the compute endpoint ID on your branch page.
curl
--request
PATCH
\
--url
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/{project_id}/endpoints/{endpoint_id}
\
--header
'accept: application/json'
\

'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
\
--header
'content-type: application/json'
\
--data
'
{
"endpoint": {
"suspend_timeout_seconds": 300
}
}
'
Consider combining this strategy with Neon's
Autoscaling
feature, which allows you to run a compute with minimal resources and scale up on demand. For example, with autoscaling, you can configure a minimum compute size to reduce costs during off-peak times. In the image shown below, the scale to zero setting is set to 1 hour so that your compute only suspends after an hour of inactivity, and autoscaling is configured with a minimum compute size that keep costs low during periods of light usage.
For autoscaling configuration instructions, see
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
.
Place your application and database in the same region
A key strategy for reducing connection latency is ensuring that your application and database are hosted in the same region, or as close as possible, geographically. For the regions supported by Neon, see
Regions
. For information about moving your database to a different region, see
Import data from another Neon project
.
Increase your connection timeout
By configuring longer connection timeout durations, your application has more time to accommodate cold starts and other factors that contribute to latency.
Connection timeout settings are typically configured in your application or the database client library you're using, and the specific way to do it depends on the language or framework you're using.
Here are examples of how to increase connection timeout settings in a few common programming languages and frameworks:
Node.js
Python
Java
Prisma
const
{
Pool
}
=
require
(
'pg'
);
const
pool
=
new
Pool
({
connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
connectionTimeoutMillis
:
10000
,
// connection timeout in milliseconds
idleTimeoutMillis
:
10000
,
// idle timeout in milliseconds
});
note
If you are using Prisma Client, your timeout issue could be related to Prisma's connection pool configuration. The Prisma Client query engine instantiates its own connection pool when it opens a first connection to the database. If you encounter a
Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool
error, refer to
Prisma connection pool timeouts
for information about configuring your Prisma connection pool size and pool timeout settings.
Remember that increasing connection timeout settings might impact the responsiveness of your application, and users could end up waiting longer for their requests to be processed. Always test and monitor your application's performance when making changes like these.
Build connection timeout handling into your application
You can prepare your application to handle connection timeouts when latency is unavoidable. This might involve using retries with exponential backoff. This Javascript example connects to the database using the
pg
library and uses the
node-retry
library to handle connection retries with an exponential backoff. The general logic can be easily translated into other languages.
require
(
'dotenv'
)
.config
();
var
Client
=
require
(
'pg'
).Client;
var
retry
=
require
(
'retry'
);
// Connection string from .env file
var
connectionString
=
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
;
function
connectWithRetry
() {
var
operation
=
retry
.operation
({
retries
:
5
,
// number of retries before giving up
minTimeout
:
4000
,
// minimum time between retries in milliseconds
randomize
:
true
,
// adds randomness to timeouts to prevent retries from overwhelming the server
});
operation
.attempt
(
function
(currentAttempt) {
var
client
=
new
Client
({ connectionString });
client
.connect
()
.then
(
function
() {
console
.log
(
'Connected to the database'
);
// Perform your operations with the client
// For example, let's run a simple SELECT query
return
client
.query
(
'SELECT NOW()'
);
})
.then
(
function
(res) {
console
.log
(
res
.rows[
0
]);
return
client
.end
();
})
.catch
(
function
(err) {
if
(
operation
.retry
(err)) {
console
.warn
(
`Failed to connect on attempt
${
currentAttempt
}
, retrying...`
);
}
else
{
console
.error
(
'Failed to connect to the database after multiple attempts:'
,
err);
}
});
});
}
// Usage
connectWithRetry
();
In the example above, the
operation.attempt
function initiates the connection logic. If the connection fails (i.e.,
client.connect()
returns a rejected Promise), the error is passed to
operation.retry
(err). If there are retries left, the retry function schedules another attempt with a delay based on the parameters defined in the
retry.operation
. The delay between retries is controlled by the
minTimeout
and
randomize
options.
The randomize option adds a degree of randomness to the delay to prevent a large number of retries from potentially overwhelming the server. The
minTimeout
option defines the minimum time between retries in milliseconds.
However, this example is a simplification. In a production application, you might want to use a more sophisticated strategy. For example, you could initially attempt to reconnect quickly in the event of a transient network issue, then fall back to slower retries if the problem persists.

SQL Alchemy: Dealing with disconnects
Fast API blog post: Recycling connections for Neon's scale to zero
Use application-level caching
Implement a caching system like
Redis
to store frequently accessed data, which can be rapidly served to users. This approach can help reduce occurrences of latency, but only if the data requested is available in the cache. Challenges with this strategy include cache invalidation due to frequently changing data, and cache misses when queries request uncached data. This strategy will not avoid latency entirely, but you may be able to combine it with other strategies to improve application responsiveness overall.
Optimizing connection latency with sslnegotiation
Starting with PostgreSQL 17, you can use the
sslnegotiation
connection parameter to control how SSL negotiation is handled when establishing a connection. The
sslnegotiation=direct
option reduces connection latency by skipping unnecessary negotiation steps.
Neon has implemented support for
sslnegotiation=direct
in our proxy layer, allowing you to benefit from faster connection times even if your database runs on an older PostgreSQL version. You just need a PostgreSQL 17 client to use this feature.
Here's a comparison of connection times with and without the
sslnegotiation=direct
parameter:
Without sslnegotiation=direct:
$
time
psql
"postgresql://neondb_owner@your-neon-endpoint/neondb?sslmode=require"
-c
"SELECT version();"
version

)
real
0m0.753s
user
0m0.016s
sys
0m0.005s
As shown in the example above, using
sslnegotiation=direct
reduces the connection time by skipping the initial SSL negotiation step. To use this optimization, simply append
sslnegotiation=direct
to your connection string:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=verify-full&sslnegotiation=direct
Conclusion
With the right strategies, you can optimize your system to handle connection latencies and timeouts, ensuring your application delivers a consistently high level of performance. The best solution often involves a combination of strategies, so experiment and find the right configuration for your specific use case.

About Connection pooling
Learn how connection pooling works in Neon
Neon uses
PgBouncer
to support connection pooling, enabling up to 10,000 concurrent connections. PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for Postgres.
How to use connection pooling
To use connection pooling with Neon, use a pooled connection string instead of a regular connection string. A pooled connection string adds the
-pooler
option to your endpoint ID, as shown below:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
The
Connect to your database modal
, which you can access by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
, provides
Connection pooling
toggle that adds the
-pooler
option to a connection string for you. You can copy a pooled connection string from the
Dashboard
or manually add the
-pooler
option to the endpoint ID in an existing connection string.
info
The
-pooler
option routes the connection to a connection pooling port at the Neon Proxy.
Connection limits without connection pooling
Each Postgres connection creates a new process in the operating system, which consumes resources. Postgres limits the number of open connections for this reason. The Postgres connection limit is defined by the Postgres
max_connections
parameter. In Neon,
max_connections
is set according to your compute size or autoscaling configuration — you can find the formula here:
Parameter settings that differ by compute size

You can check the
max_connections
limit for your compute by running the following query from the Neon SQL Editor or a client connected to Neon:
SHOW max_connections;
note
Seven connections are reserved for the Neon-managed Postgres
superuser
account. For example, for a 0.25 compute size, 7/112 connections are reserved, so you would only have 105 available connections. If you are running queries from the Neon SQL Editor, that will also use a connection. To view connections that are currently open, you can run the following query:
SELECT
usename
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE
datname
=
'<database_name>'
;
Even with the largest compute size, the
max_connections
limit may not be sufficient for some applications, such as those that use serverless functions. To increase the number of connections that Neon supports, you can use
connection pooling
. All Neon plans, including the
Neon Free Plan
, support connection pooling.
Connection pooling
Some applications open numerous connections, with most eventually becoming inactive. This behavior can often be attributed to database driver limitations, running many instances of an application, or applications with serverless functions. With regular Postgres, new connections are rejected when reaching the
max_connections
limit. To overcome this limitation, Neon supports connection pooling using
PgBouncer
, which allows Neon to support up to 10,000 concurrent connections.
Connection pooling, however, is not a magic bullet: As the name implies, connections share a pool of connections to Postgres — a pool of connections sitting in front of a limited number of direct connections to Postgres.
To ensure that direct access to Postgres is still possible for administrative tasks or similar, the pooler is configured to only open up a certain number of direct Postgres connections for each user to each database. This number of direct Postgres connections is determined by the PgBouncer
default_pool_size
setting, which is in turn determined by your compute's
max_connections
setting. For example, if
default_pool_size
is
100
, there can be only
100
active connections from role
alex
to any particular database through the pooler. All other connections by
alex
to that database will have to wait for one of those
100
active connections to complete their transactions before the next connection's work is started.
At the same time, role
dana
will also be able to connect to the same database through the pooler and have up to
100
concurrent active transactions across the same number of connections.
Similarly, even if role
alex
has
100
concurrently active transactions through the pooler to the same database, that role can still start up to
100
concurrent transactions to a different database when connected through the pooler.
The
max_connections
setting still applies for direct Postgres connections.
important
You will not be able to get interactive results from all 10,000 connections at the same time. Connections to the pooler endpoint still consume connections on the main Postgres endpoint: PgBouncer forwards operations from a role's connections through its own pool of connections to Postgres, and adaptively adds more connections to Postgres as needed by other concurrently active role connections. The 10,000 connection limit is therefore most useful for "serverless" applications and application-side connection pools that have many open connections but infrequent and short
transactions
.
PgBouncer
PgBouncer is an open-source connection pooler for Postgres. When an application needs to connect to a database, PgBouncer provides a connection from the pool. Connections in the pool are routed to a smaller number of actual Postgres connections. When a connection is no longer required, it is returned to the pool and is available to be used again. Maintaining a pool of available connections improves performance by reducing the number of connections that need to be created and torn down to service incoming requests. Connection pooling also helps avoid rejected connections. When all connections in the pool are being used, PgBouncer queues a new request until a connection from the pool becomes available.
Neon PgBouncer configuration settings
Neon's PgBouncer configuration is shown below. The settings are not user-configurable, but if you are a paid plan user and require a different setting, please contact
Neon Support
. For example, Neon sometimes raises the
default_pool_size
setting for users who support a large number of concurrent connections and repeatedly hit PgBouncer's pool size limit.
[pgbouncer]
pool_mode=
transaction
max_client_conn=
10000
default_pool_size=
0.9 * max_connections
max_prepared_statements=
0
query_wait_timeout=
120
where
max_connections
is a Postgres setting.
The following list describes each setting. For a full explanation of each parameter, please refer to the official
PgBouncer documentation
.
pool_mode=transaction
: The pooling mode PgBouncer uses, set to
transaction
pooling.
max_client_conn=10000
: Maximum number of client connections allowed.
default_pool_size
: Default number of server connections to allow per user/database pair. The formula is 0.9 *
max_connections
. For
max_connections
details, see
Parameter settings
.
max_prepared_statements=0
: Maximum number of prepared statements a connection is allowed to have at the same time.
0
means prepared statements are disabled.
query_wait_timeout=120
: Maximum time queries are allowed to spend waiting for execution. Neon uses the default setting of
120
seconds.
Connection pooling in transaction mode
As mentioned above, Neon uses PgBouncer in
transaction mode
(
pool_mode=transaction
), which limits some functionality in Postgres. Functionality
NOT supported
in transaction mode includes:
SET
/
RESET
LISTEN
WITH HOLD CURSOR
PREPARE / DEALLOCATE
PRESERVE
/
DELETE ROWS
temp tables
LOAD
statement
Session-level advisory locks
These session-level features are not supported
transaction mode
because:
In this mode, database connections are allocated from the pool on a per-transaction basis
Session states are not persisted across transactions
Avoid using SET statements over a pooled connection
Due to the transaction mode limitation described above, users often encounter issues when running
SET
statements over a pooled connection. For example, if you set the Postgres
search_path
session variable using a
SET search_path
statement over a pooled connection, the setting is only valid for the duration of the transaction. As a result, a session variable like
search_path
will not remain set for subsequent transactions.
This particular
search_path
issue often shows up as a
relation does not exist
error. To avoid this error, you can:
Use a direct connection string when you need to set the search path and have it persist across multiple transactions.
Explicitly specify the schema in your queries so that you don’t need to set the search path.
Use an
ALTER ROLE your_role_name SET search_path TO <schema1>, <schema2>, <schema3>;
command to set a persistent search path for the role executing queries. See the
ALTER ROLE
.
Similar issues can occur when attempting to use
pg_dump
over a pooled connection. A
pg_dump
operation typically executes several
SET
statements during data ingestion, and these settings will not persist over a pool connection. For these reasons, we recommend using
pg_dump
only over a direct connection.
For the official list of limitations, refer to the "
SQL feature map for pooling modes
" section in the
pgbouncer.org Features
documentation.
Connection pooling with schema migration tools
We recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection string when performing migrations using Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) and similar schema migration tools. With the exception of recent versions of
Prisma ORM, which support using a pooled connection string with Neon
, using a pooled connection string for migrations is likely not supported or prone to errors. Before attempting to perform migrations over a pooled connection string, please refer to your tool's documentation to determine if pooled connections are supported.
Optimize queries with PgBouncer and prepared statements
Protocol-level prepared statements are supported with Neon and PgBouncer as of the
PgBouncer 1.22.0 release
. Using prepared statements can help boost query performance while providing an added layer of protection against potential SQL injection attacks.
Understanding prepared statements
A prepared statement in Postgres allows for the optimization of an SQL query by defining its structure once and executing it multiple times with varied parameters. Here's an SQL-level example to illustrate. Note that direct SQL-level
PREPARE
and
EXECUTE
are not supported with PgBouncer (see
below
), so you can't use this query from the SQL Editor. It is meant to give you a clear idea of how a prepared statement works. Refer to the protocol-level samples below to see how this SQL-level example translates to different protocol-level examples.
PREPARE fetch_plan (
TEXT
)
AS
SELECT
*
FROM
users
WHERE
username
=
$
1
;
EXECUTE
fetch_plan(
'alice'
);
fetch_plan
here is the prepared statement's name, and
$1
acts as a parameter placeholder.
The benefits of using prepared statements include:
Performance
: Parsing the SQL and creating the execution plan happens just once, speeding up subsequent executions. This performance benefit would be most noticeable on databases with heavy and repeated traffic.
Security
: By sending data values separately from the query, prepared statements reduce the risk of SQL injection attacks.
You can learn more about prepared statements in the PostgreSQL documentation. See
PREPARE
.
Use prepared statements with PgBouncer
Since pgBouncer supports protocol-level prepared statements only, you must rely on PostgreSQL client libraries instead (direct SQL-level
PREPARE
and
EXECUTE
are not supported). Fortunately, most PostgreSQL client libraries support prepared statements. Here are a couple of examples showing how to use prepared statements with Javascript and Python client libraries:
pg
psycopg2
const
query
=
{
// give the query a unique name
name
:
'fetch-plan'
,
text
:
'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1'
,
values
:
[
'alice'
]
,
};
client
.query
(query);

Passwordless auth
Learn how to connect to Neon without a password
Neon's
psql
passwordless auth feature helps you quickly authenticate a connection to Neon without providing a password.
The following instructions require a working installation of
psql
, an interactive terminal for working with Postgres. For information about
psql
, refer to the
psql reference
, in the
PostgreSQL Documentation
.

Connect with psql
Learn how to connect to Neon using psql
The following instructions require a working installation of
psql
. The
psql
client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres and running ad-hoc queries. For more information about
psql
, refer to the
psql reference
, in the
PostgreSQL Documentation
.
note
A Neon compute runs Postgres, which means that any Postgres application or standard utility such as
psql
is compatible with Neon. You can also use Postgres client libraries and drivers to connect. However, please be aware that some older client libraries and drivers, including older
psql
executables, are built without
Server Name Indication (SNI)
support and require a workaround. For more information, see
Connection errors
.
Neon also provides a passwordless auth feature that uses
psql
. For more information, see
Passwordless auth
.
How to install psql
If you don't have
psql
installed already, follow these steps to get set up:
Mac
Linux
Windows
brew
install
libpq
echo
'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"'
>>
~/.zshrc
source
~/.zshrc
Connect to Neon with psql
The easiest way to connect to Neon using
psql
is with a connection string.
You can obtain a connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
From your terminal or command prompt, run the
psql
client with the connection string copied from the Neon
Dashboard
.
psql
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
note
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption, but you can increase the level of protection using the
sslmode
parameter setting in your connection string. For instructions, see
Connect to Neon securely
.
Where do I obtain a password?
You can obtain a Neon connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
What port does Neon use?
Neon uses the default Postgres port,
5432
. If you need to specify the port in your connection string, you can do so as follows:
psql
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname][:port]/[dbname]
Running queries
After establishing a connection, try running the following queries:
CREATE
TABLE
my_table
AS
SELECT
now
();
SELECT
*
FROM
my_table;
The following result set is returned:

Meta-commands
The
psql
client supports a variety of meta-commands, which act like shortcuts for interacting with your database.
Benefits of Meta-Commands
Meta-commands can significantly speed up your workflow by providing quick access to database schemas and other critical information without needing to write full SQL queries. They are especially useful for database management tasks, making it easier to handle administrative duties directly from the Neon Console.
Available meta-commands
Here are some of the meta-commands that you can use with
psql
.
note
The Neon SQL Editor also supports meta-commands. See

Getting started with Neon Data API
Early Access
Neon Data API
is available for members of our Early Access Program.
Sign up
and help shape the future of Neon.
Related docs
Neon Auth
Demo app
Neon Data API Demo App
The Neon Data API is a ready-to-use REST API for your Neon database, powered by
PostgREST
, a trusted project in the PostgreSQL community. It lets you work with every table, view, or function in a database's schema using standard HTTP verbs (
GET
,
POST
,
PATCH
,
DELETE
). Even better, you can use a handy SDK like
postgrest-js
,
postgrest-py
, or
postgrest-go
to run queries from your client:
const
{
data
}
=
await
client
.from
(
'playing_with_neon'
)
.select
(
'*'
)
.gte
(
'value'
,
0.5
);
When using the Data API, it is essential to set up RLS policies so that you can safely expose your databases to clients such as web apps. Make sure that
all
of your tables have RLS policies, and that you have carefully reviewed each policy.
Enabling the Data API
You enable the Data API at the branch level for a single database.
Go to the
Data API
tab for your branch and click the button to enable the Data API.
Once enabled, you'll see your Data API Project URL here. Use this endpoint in your application.
Next step:
To secure your Data API, create Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for your tables. Using
Drizzle RLS
makes this much easier.
API Authentication
When you call the
/data-api
endpoint described above, we automatically provision
Neon Auth
for that project. We set up the Data API's authentication to match this instance of Neon Auth.
This means you need to send a valid JWT from Neon Auth with every Data API request that is protected by RLS policies.
Third-party auth
You can also bring your own
JWKS
from a third-party provider (like Clerk, Keycloak, Auth0, or Better Auth), adding more auth flexibility. Just include
jwks_url
(and optionally
jwks_audience
) in your request:
curl
--location
'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches/<branch_id>/data-api'
\
--header
'Content-Type: application/json'
\
--header
'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
\
--data
'{
"jwks_url": "https://url.to.your/.well-known/jwks.json"
}'
Using the Data API
By default, all tables in your database are accessible via the API with
SELECT
permissions granted to
unauthenticated requests
. This lets you directly interact with the API without requiring additional authorization headers.
warning
We strongly recommend enabling Row Level Security (RLS) on
all
tables as soon as you enable the Data API. You can do this with:
-- for every table, on every schema
ALTER
TABLE
<
schema_name
>
.
<
table_name
>
ENABLE
ROW
LEVEL
SECURITY
;
Review and test your RLS policies to ensure your data is protected.
Here’s an example of how you might set up and query a table:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER
TABLE
playing_with_neon
ENABLE
ROW
LEVEL
SECURITY
;
-- (Optional) Example permissive policy for demo/testing:
CREATE
POLICY
"Allow read access"

As the Data API is built on
PostgREST
, it follows PostgREST query and data manipulation formats. You can also use popular wrapper libraries such as
postgrest-js
https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js
for more advanced integration.
import
{ PostgrestClient }
from
'@supabase/postgrest-js'

Live demo
This project shows how to build a modern web app using direct-to-database queries (no backend required) with the Neon Data API and Neon Auth for authentication.
What's Next?
Faster cold starts (we're working on it)
With these features in place, the Data API will become fully extensible to any service capable of signing a
JWT
. Combined with
Row-Level Security (RLS)
policies, you'll be able to create powerful backends for both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

The neon extension
An extension for Neon-specific statistics including the Local File Cache hit ratio
The
neon
extension provides functions and views designed to gather Neon-specific metrics.
The
neon_stat_file_cache
view
Views for Neon internal use
The neon_stat_file_cache view
The
neon_stat_file_cache
view provides insights into how effectively your Neon compute's Local File Cache (LFC) is being used.
What is the Local File Cache?
Neon computes have a Local File Cache (LFC), which is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data in the local memory of the Neon compute. Like Postgres
shared buffers
, the LFC reduces latency and improves query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from Neon storage. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres shared buffers. In Neon computes, the
shared_buffers
parameter
scales with compute size
. The LFC extends the cache memory to approximately 75% of your compute's RAM. To view the LFC size for each Neon compute size, see
How to size your compute
.
When data is requested, Postgres checks shared buffers first, then the LFC. If the requested data is not found in the LFC, it is read from Neon storage. Shared buffers and the LFC both cache your most recently accessed data, but they may not cache exactly the same data due to different cache eviction patterns. The LFC is also much larger than shared buffers, so it stores significantly more data.
Monitoring Local File Cache usage
You can monitor Local File Cache (LFC) usage by installing the
neon
extension on your database and querying the
neon_stat_file_cache
view or
using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
. Additionally, you can monitor the
Local file cache hit rate
graph on the
Monitoring
page in the Neon console.
neon_stat_file_cache view
The
neon_stat_file_cache
view includes the following metrics:
file_cache_misses
: The number of times the requested page block is not found in Postgres shared buffers or the LFC. In this case, the page block is retrieved from Neon storage.
file_cache_hits
: The number of times the requested page block was not found in Postgres shared buffers but was found in the LFC.
file_cache_used
: The number of times the LFC was accessed.
file_cache_writes
: The number of writes to the LFC. A write occurs when a requested page block is not found in Postgres shared buffers or the LFC. In this case, the data is retrieved from Neon storage and then written to shared buffers and the LFC.
file_cache_hit_ratio
: The percentage of database requests that are served from the LFC rather than Neon storage. This is a measure of cache efficiency, indicating how often requested data is found in the cache. A higher cache hit ratio suggests better performance, as accessing data from memory is faster than accessing data from storage. The ratio is calculated using the following formula:
file_cache_hit_ratio
=
(file_cache_hits
/
(file_cache_hits
+
file_cache_misses
))
*
100
For OLTP workloads, you should aim for a cache hit ratio of 99% or better. However, the ideal cache hit ratio depends on your specific workload and data access patterns. In some cases, a slightly lower ratio might still be acceptable, especially if the workload involves a lot of sequential scanning of large tables where caching might be less effective. If you find that your cache hit ration is quite low, your working set may not be fully or adequately in memory. In this case, consider using a larger compute with more memory. Please keep in mind that the statistics are for the entire compute, not specific databases or tables.
Using the neon_stat_file_cache view
To use the
neon_stat_file_cache
view, install the
neon
extension on your database:
To install the extension on a database:
CREATE
EXTENSION neon;
To connect to your database. You can find a connection string for your database on the Neon Dashboard.
psql
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
Issue the following query to view LFC usage data for your compute:
SELECT
*
FROM
neon_stat_file_cache;
file_cache_misses | file_cache_hits | file_cache_used | file_cache_writes | file_cache_hit_ratio

note
Local File Cache statistics represent the lifetime of your compute, from the last time the compute started until the time you ran the query. Be aware that statistics are lost when your compute stops and gathered again from scratch when your compute restarts. You'll only want to run the cache hit ratio query after a representative workload has been run. For example, say that you increased your compute size after seeing a cache hit ratio below 99%. Changing the compute size restarts your compute, so you lose all of your current usage statistics. In this case, you should run your workload before you try the cache hit ratio query again to see if your cache hit ratio improved.
Remember that Postgres checks shared buffers first before it checks your compute's Local File Cache. If you are only working with a small amount of data, queries may be served entirely from the shared buffers, resulting in no LFC hits.
View LFC metrics with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
You can also use
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
with the
FILECACHE
and
PREFETCH
options to view LFC cache hit and miss data, as well as prefetch statistics. Installing the
neon
extension is not required. For example:

PREFETCH option
The
PREFETCH
option provides information about Neon's prefetching mechanism, which predicts which pages will be needed soon and sends prefetch requests to the page server before the page is actually requested by the executor. This helps reduce latency by having data ready when it's needed. The PREFETCH option includes the following metrics:
hits
- Number of pages received from the page server before actually requested by the executor. Prefetch distance is controlled by the
effective_io_concurrency
parameter. The larger this value, the more likely the page server will complete the request before it's needed. However, it should not be larger than
neon.prefetch_buffer_size
.
misses
- Number of accessed pages that were not prefetched. Prefetch is not implemented for all plan nodes, and even for supported nodes (like sequential scan), some mispredictions can occur.
expired
- Pages that were updated since the prefetch request was sent, or results that weren't used because the executor didn't need the page (for example, due to a
LIMIT
clause in the query).
duplicates
- Multiple prefetch requests for the same page. For some nodes like sequential scan, predicting next pages is straightforward. However, for index scans that prefetch referenced heap pages, index entries can have multiple references to the same heap page, resulting in duplicate prefetch requests.
FILECACHE option
The
FILECACHE
option provides information about the Local File Cache (LFC) usage during query execution:
hits
- Number of accessed pages found in the LFC.
misses
- Number of accessed pages not found in the LFC.
Views for Neon internal use

neon
extension is installed by default to a system-owned
postgres
database in each Neon project. The
postgres
database includes functions and views owned by the Neon system role (

The pgvector extension
Enable Postgres as a vector store with the pgvector extension
The
pgvector
extension enables you to store vector embeddings and perform vector similarity search in Postgres. It is particularly useful for applications involving natural language processing, such as those built on top of OpenAI's GPT models.
pgvector
supports:
Exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
Single-precision, half-precision, binary, and sparse vectors
L2 distance, inner product, cosine distance, L1 distance, Hamming distance, and Jaccard distance
Any language with a Postgres client
ACID compliance, point-in-time recovery, JOINs, and all other Postgres features
This topic describes how to enable the
pgvector
extension in Neon and how to create, store, and query vectors.
Try it on Neon!
Neon is Serverless Postgres built for the cloud. Explore Postgres features and functions in our user-friendly SQL editor. Sign up for a free account to get started.

Enable the pgvector extension
You can enable the
pgvector
extension by running the following
CREATE EXTENSION
statement in the
Neon SQL Editor
or from a client such as
psql
that is connected to Neon.
CREATE
EXTENSION vector;
Use a previous version of pgvector
Neon allows you to install the previous version of
pgvector
, which is one version behind the latest supported version.
For example, if Neon’s latest supported
pgvector
version is 0.8.0, you can install the prior version, 0.7.4, by specifying the version number:
CREATE
EXTENSION vector
VERSION
'0.7.4'
;
To check the latest supported
pgvector
version on Neon, visit our
Postgres extension page
. You can install one version back from that version.
For a full version history, see the
pgvector changelog
. Note that
pgvector
versions are not always sequential — for example, version 0.7.4 was followed by 0.8.0.
Create a table to store vectors
To create a table for storing vectors, you would use an SQL command similar to the following. Embeddings are stored in the
VECTOR
type column. You can adjust the number of dimensions as needed.
CREATE
TABLE
items
(
id
BIGSERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
embedding VECTOR(
3
)
);
note
The
pgvector
extension supports some specialized types other than
VECTOR
for storing embeddings. See
HNSW vector types
, and
IVFFlat vector types
.
This command generates a table named
items
with an
embedding
column capable of storing vectors with 3 dimensions. OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-small
model supports 1536 dimensions by default for each piece of text, which creates more accurate embeddings for natural language processing tasks. However, using larger embeddings generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory, and storage than using smaller embeddings. To learn more about embeddings and the cost-performance tradeoff, see
Embeddings
, in the
OpenAI documentation
.
Storing embeddings
After generating embeddings using a service like
OpenAI’s Embeddings API
, you can store them in your database. Using a Postgres client library in your preferred programming language, you can execute an
INSERT
statement similar to the following to store embeddings.
Insert two new rows into the
items
table with the provided embeddings.
INSERT INTO
items (embedding)
VALUES
(
'[1,2,3]'
), (
'[4,5,6]'
);
Load vectors in bulk using the
COPY
command:
COPY
items (embedding)
FROM
STDIN
WITH
(FORMAT
BINARY
);
tip
For a Python script that loads embeddings in bulk, refer to this
Bulk loading with COPY
example provided in the
pgvector
GitHub repository.
Upsert vectors:
INSERT INTO
items (id, embedding)
VALUES
(
1
,
'[1,2,3]'
), (
2
,
'[4,5,6]'
)
ON
CONFLICT (id) DO
UPDATE
SET
embedding
=
EXCLUDED.embedding;
Update vectors:
UPDATE
items
SET
embedding
=
'[1,2,3]'
WHERE
id
=
1
;
Delete vectors:
DELETE
FROM
items
WHERE
id
=
1
;
Querying vectors
To retrieve vectors and calculate similarity, use
SELECT
statements and the distance function operators supported by
pgvector
.
Get the nearest neighbor to a vector by L2 distance:
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
embedding
<->
'[3,1,2]'
LIMIT
5
;
Get the nearest neighbor to a row by L2 distance:
SELECT
*
FROM
items
WHERE
id
!=
1
ORDER BY
embedding
<->
(
SELECT
embedding
FROM
items
WHERE
id
=
1
)
LIMIT
5
;
Get rows within a certain distance by L2 distance:
SELECT
*
FROM
items
WHERE
embedding
<->
'[3,1,2]'
<
5
;
note
To use an index with a query, include
ORDER BY
and
LIMIT
clauses, as shown in the second query example above.
Distance function operators
<->
- L2 distance
<#>
- (negative) inner product
<=>
- cosine distance
<+>
- L1 distance
note
The inner product operator (
<#>
) returns the negative inner product since Postgres only supports
ASC
order index scans on operators.
Distance queries
Get the distances:
SELECT
embedding
<->
'[3,1,2]'
AS
distance
FROM
items;
For inner product, multiply by
-1
(since
<#>
returns the negative inner product):
SELECT
(embedding
<
#
>
'[3,1,2]'
)
*
-
1
AS
inner_product
FROM
items;
For cosine similarity, use
1 -
cosine distance:
SELECT
1
-
(embedding
<=>
'[3,1,2]'
)
AS
cosine_similarity
FROM
items;
Aggregate queries
To average vectors:
SELECT
AVG
(embedding)
FROM
items;
To average groups of vectors:
SELECT
category_id,
AVG
(embedding)
FROM
items
GROUP BY
category_id;
Indexing vectors
By default,
pgvector
performs exact nearest neighbor search, providing perfect recall. Adding an index on the vector column can improve query performance with a minor cost in recall. Unlike typical indexes, you will see different results for queries after adding an approximate index.
Supported index types include:
HNSW
IVFFLAT
HNSW
An HNSW index creates a multilayer graph. It has better query performance than an IVFFlat index (in terms of speed-recall tradeoff), but has slower build times and uses more memory. Also, an HNSW index can be created without any data in the table since there isn’t a training step like there is for an IVFFlat index.
HNSW vector types
HNSW indexes are supported with the following vector types:
vector
- up to 2,000 dimensions
halfvec
- up to 4,000 dimensions
bit
- up to 64,000 dimensions
sparsevec
- up to 1,000 non-zero elements
note
Notice how indexes are defined differently depending on the distance function being used. For example
vector_l2_ops
is specified for L2 distance,
vector_ip_ops
for inner product, and so on. Make sure you define your index according to the distance function you intend to use.
L2 distance:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops);
Inner product:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);
Cosine distance:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
L1 distance:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_l1_ops);
Hamming distance:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding bit_hamming_ops);
Jaccard distance:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding bit_jaccard_ops);
HNSW index build options
m
- the max number of connections per layer (16 by default)
ef_construction
- the size of the dynamic candidate list for constructing the graph (
64
by default)
This example demonstrates how to set the parameters:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH
(m
=
16
, ef_construction
=
64
);
A higher value of
ef_construction
provides better recall at the cost of index build time and insert speed.
HNSW index query options
You can specify the size of the candidate list for search. The size is
40
by default.
SET
hnsw.ef_search
=
100
;
A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed.
This query shows how to use
SET LOCAL
inside a transaction to set
ef_search
for a single query:
BEGIN
;
SET
LOCAL
hnsw.ef_search
=
100
;
SELECT
...
COMMIT
;
HNSW index build time
To optimize index build time, consider configuring the
maintenance_work_mem
and
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
session variables before building an index:
note
Like other index types, it’s faster to create an index after loading your initial data.
maintenance_work_mem
Indexes build significantly faster when the graph fits into Postgres
maintenance_work_mem
.
A notice is shown when the graph no longer fits:
NOTICE:  hnsw graph no longer fits into maintenance_work_mem after 100000 tuples
DETAIL:  Building will take significantly more time.
HINT:  Increase maintenance_work_mem to speed up builds.
In Postgres, the
maintenance_work_mem
setting determines the maximum memory allocation for tasks such as
CREATE INDEX
. The default
maintenance_work_mem
value in Neon is set according to your Neon
compute size
.
To optimize
pgvector
index build time, you can increase the
maintenance_work_mem
setting for the current session with a command similar to the following:
SET
maintenance_work_mem
=
'10 GB'
;
The recommended setting is your working set size (the size of your tuples for vector index creation). However, your
maintenance_work_mem
setting should not exceed 50 to 60 percent of your compute's available RAM. For example, the
maintenance_work_mem='10 GB'
setting shown above has been successfully tested on a 7 CU compute, which has 28 GB of RAM, as 10 GB is less than 50% of the RAM available for that compute size.
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
You can also speed up index creation by increasing the number of parallel workers. The default is
2
.
The
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be started by a single utility command such as
CREATE INDEX
. By default, the
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
setting is
2
. For efficient parallel index creation, you can increase this setting. Parallel workers are taken from the pool of processes established by
max_worker_processes
(
10
), limited by
max_parallel_workers
(
8
).
You can increase the
maintenance_work_mem
setting for the current session with a command similar to the following:
SET
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
=
7
For example, if you have a 7 CU compute size, you could set
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
to 7, before index creation, to make use of all of the vCPUs available.
For a large number of workers, you may also need to increase the Postgres
max_parallel_workers
, which is
8
by default.
Check indexing progress
You can check indexing progress with the following query:
SELECT
phase,
round
(
100
.
0
*
blocks_done
/
nullif
(blocks_total,
0
),
1
)
AS
"%"
FROM
pg_stat_progress_create_index;
The phases for HNSW are:
initializing
loading tuples
For related information, see
CREATE INDEX Progress Reporting
, in the
PostgreSQL documentation
.
IVFFlat
An IVFFlat index divides vectors into lists and searches a subset of those lists that are closest to the query vector. It has faster build times and uses less memory than HNSW, but has lower query performance with respect to the speed-recall tradeoff.
Keys to achieving good recall include:
Creating the index after the table has some data
Choosing an appropriate number of lists. A good starting point is rows/1000 for up to 1M rows and
sqrt(rows)
for over 1M rows.
Specifying an appropriate number of
probes
when querying. A higher number is better for recall, and a lower is better for speed. A good starting point is
sqrt(lists)
.
IVFFlat vector types
IVFFlat indexes are supported with the following vector types:
vector
- up to 2,000 dimensions
halfvec
- up to 4,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0)
bit
- up to 64,000 dimensions (added in 0.7.0)
The following examples show how to add an index for each distance function:
note
Notice how indexes are defined differently depending on the distance function being used. For example
vector_l2_ops
is specified for L2 distance,
vector_cosine_ops
for cosine distance, and so on.
The following examples show how to add an index for each distance function:
L2 distance
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WITH
(lists
=
100
);
note
Use
halfvec_l2_ops
for halfvec (and similar with the other distance functions).
Inner product
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
ivfflat (embedding vector_ip_ops)
WITH
(lists
=
100
);
Cosine distance
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
ivfflat (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH
(lists
=
100
);
Hamming distance
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
ivfflat (embedding bit_hamming_ops)
WITH
(lists
=
100
);
IVFFlat query options
You can specify the number of probes, which is
1
by default.
SET
ivfflat.probes
=
10
;
A higher value provides better recall at the cost of speed. You can set the value to the number of lists for exact nearest neighbor search, at which point the planner won’t use the index.
You can also use
SET LOCAL
inside a transaction to set the number of probes for a single query:
BEGIN
;
SET
LOCAL
ivfflat.probes
=
10
;
SELECT
...
COMMIT
;
IVFFlat index build time
To optimize index build time, consider configuring the
maintenance_work_mem
and
max_parallel_maintenance_workers
session variables before building an index:

maintenance_work_mem
In Postgres, the
maintenance_work_mem
setting determines the maximum memory allocation for tasks such as
CREATE INDEX

maintenance_work_mem
value in Neon is set according to your Neon
compute size

maintenance_work_mem
setting by compute size, see
Parameter settings that differ by compute size
.
To optimize
pgvector
index build time, you can increase the
maintenance_work_mem
setting for the current session with a command similar to the following:

maintenance_work_mem
=
'10 GB'

Filtering
There are a few ways to index nearest neighbor queries with a
WHERE
clause:
SELECT
*
FROM
items
WHERE
category_id
=
123
ORDER BY
embedding
<->
'[3,1,2]'
LIMIT
5
;
Create an index on one or more of the
WHERE
columns for exact search"
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items (category_id);
Create a
partial index
on the vector column for approximate search:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw (embedding vector_l2_ops)
WHERE
(category_id
=
123
);
Use
partitioning
for approximate search on many different values of the
WHERE
columns:
CREATE
TABLE
items
(embedding vector(
3
), category_id
int
)
PARTITION
BY
LIST(category_id);
Half-precision vectors
Half-precision vectors enable the storage of vector embeddings using 16-bit floating-point numbers, or half-precision, which reduces both storage size and memory usage by nearly half compared 32-bit floats. This efficiency comes with minimal loss in precision, making half-precision vectors beneficial for applications dealing with large datasets or facing memory constraints.
When integrating OpenAI's embeddings, you can take advantage of half-precision vectors by storing embeddings in a compressed format. For instance, OpenAI’s high-dimensional embeddings can be effectively stored with half-precision vectors, achieving high levels of accuracy, such as a 98% rate. This approach optimizes memory usage while maintaining performance.
You can use the
halfvec
type to store half-precision vectors, as shown here:
CREATE
TABLE
items
(id
bigserial
PRIMARY KEY
, embedding halfvec(
3
));
Binary vectors
Binary vector embeddings are a form of vector representation where each component is encoded as a binary digit, typically 0 or 1. For example, the word "cat" might be represented as
[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ...],
with each position in the vector being binary.
These embeddings are advantageous for their efficiency in both storage and computation. Because they use only one bit per dimension, binary embeddings require less memory compared to traditional embeddings that use floating-point numbers. This makes them useful when there is limited memory or when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, operations with binary values are generally quicker than those involving real numbers, leading to faster computations.
However, the trade-off with binary vector embeddings is a potential loss in accuracy. Unlike denser embeddings, which have real-valued entries and can represent subtleties in the data, binary embeddings simplify the representation. This can result in a loss of information and may not fully capture the intricacies of the data they represent.
Use the
bit
type to store binary vector embeddings:
CREATE
TABLE
items
(id
bigserial
PRIMARY KEY
, embedding
bit
(
3
));
INSERT INTO
items (embedding)
VALUES
(
'000'
), (
'111'
);
Get the nearest neighbors by Hamming distance (added in 0.7.0)
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
embedding
<
~
>
'101'
LIMIT
5
;
Or (before 0.7.0)
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
bit_count
(embedding #
'101'
)
LIMIT
5
;
Jaccard distance (
<%>
) is also supported with binary vector embeddings.
Binary quantization
Binary quantization is a process that transforms dense or sparse embeddings into binary representations by thresholding vector dimensions to either 0 or 1.
Use expression indexing for binary quantization:
CREATE
INDEX
ON
items
USING
hnsw ((binary_quantize(embedding)::
bit
(
3
)) bit_hamming_ops);
Get the nearest neighbors by Hamming distance:
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
binary_quantize(embedding)::
bit
(
3
)
<
~
>
binary_quantize(
'[1,-2,3]'
)
LIMIT
5
;
Re-rank by the original vectors for better recall:
SELECT
*
FROM
(
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
binary_quantize(embedding)::
bit
(
3
)
<
~
>
binary_quantize(
'[1,-2,3]'
)
LIMIT
20
)
ORDER BY
embedding
<=>
'[1,-2,3]'
LIMIT
5
;
Sparse vectors
Sparse vectors have a large number of dimensions, where only a small proportion are non-zero.
Use the
sparsevec
type to store sparse vectors:
CREATE
TABLE
items
(id
bigserial
PRIMARY KEY
, embedding sparsevec(
5
));
Insert vectors:
INSERT INTO
items (embedding)
VALUES
(
'{1:1,3:2,5:3}/5'
), (
'{1:4,3:5,5:6}/5'
);
The format is
{index1:value1,index2:value2}/dimensions
and indices start at 1 like SQL arrays.
Get the nearest neighbors by L2 distance:
SELECT
*
FROM
items
ORDER BY
embedding
<->
'{1:3,3:1,5:2}/5'
LIMIT
5
;
Differences in behaviour between pgvector 0.5.1 and 0.7.0
Differences in behavior in the following corner cases were found during our testing of
pgvector
0.7.0:
Distance between a valid and NULL vector
The distance between a valid and
NULL
vector (
NULL::vector
) with
pgvector
0.7.0 differs from
pgvector
0.5.1 when using an HNSW or IVFFLAT index, as shown in the following examples:

Connecting Neon to your stack
Learn how to integrate Neon into your application
Using Neon as the serverless database in your tech stack means configuring connections. Whether it’s a direct connection string from your language or framework, setting environment variables for your deployment platform, connecting to ORMs like Prisma, or configuring deployment settings for CI/CD workflows, it starts with the connection.
Connecting to your application
This section provides connection string samples for various frameworks and languages, helping you integrate Neon into your tech stack.
psql
.env
Next.js
Drizzle
Prisma
Python
.NET
Ruby
Rust
Go
# psql example connection string
psql
postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database?sslmode=require
Obtaining connection details
When connecting to Neon from an application or client, you connect to a database in your Neon project. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch, which may be the default branch of your project (
production
) or a child branch.
You can obtain the database connection details you require by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a compute, a database, and a role. A connection string is constructed for you.
Neon supports pooled and direct connections to the database. Use a pooled connection string if your application uses a high number of concurrent connections. For more information, see
Connection pooling
.
A Neon connection string includes the role, password, hostname, and database name.
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
^    ^         ^                         ^                              ^
role -|    |         |- hostname               |- pooler option               |- database
|
|- password
note
The hostname includes the ID of the compute, which has an
ep-
prefix:
ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4
. For more information about Neon connection strings, see
Connection string
.
Using connection details
You can use the details from the connection string or the connection string itself to configure a connection. For example, you might place the connection details in an
.env
file, assign the connection string to a variable, or pass the connection string on the command-line.
.env
file
PGUSER=alex
PGHOST=ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
PGDATABASE=dbname
PGPASSWORD=AbC123dEf
PGPORT=5432
Variable
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname"
Command-line
psql
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-a1b2c3d4.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
note
Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption, but you can increase the level of protection by appending an
sslmode
parameter setting to your connection string. For instructions, see
Connect to Neon securely
.
FAQs
Where do I obtain a password?
It's included in your Neon connection string, which you can find by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
What port does Neon use?
Neon uses the default Postgres port,
5432
.
Network protocol support
Neon projects provisioned on AWS support both
IPv4
and
IPv6
addresses. Neon projects provisioned on Azure currently only support IPv4.
Additionally, Neon provides a serverless driver that supports both WebSocket and HTTP connections. For further information, refer to our
Neon serverless driver
documentation.
Connection notes
Some older client libraries and drivers, including older
psql
executables, are built without
Server Name Indication (SNI)
support and require a workaround. For more information, see
Connection errors
.
Some Java-based tools that use the pgJDBC driver for connecting to Postgres, such as DBeaver, DataGrip, and CLion, do not support including a role name and password in a database connection string or URL field. When you find that a connection string is not accepted, try entering the database name, role, and password values in the appropriate fields in the tool's connection UI

Developer experience with Neon
Enhancing development workflows with Neon
Discover how Neon's features can streamline your development process, reduce risks, and enhance productivity, helping you to ship faster with confidence.
Developer velocity with database branching workflows
Branch your data like code for local and preview development workflows.
Neon's branching feature lets you branch your data like you branch code. Neon branches are full database copies, including both schema and data — but we also support
schema-only branches
for those working with sensitive data. You can instantly create database branches for integration with your development workflows.
You can build your database branching workflows using the
Neon CLI
,
Neon API
, or
GitHub Actions
. For example, this example shows how to create a development branch from
production
with a simple CLI command:
neon
branches
create
--name
feature/user-auth
Neon's copy-on-write technique makes branching instantaneous and cost-efficient. Whether your database is 1 GB or 1 TiB,
it only takes seconds to create a branch
, and Neon's branches are full database copies by default — with schema-only as an option.
Also, with Neon, you can easily keep your development branches up-to-date by resetting your schema and data to the latest from
production
with a simple command.
neon
branches
reset
feature/user-auth
--parent
No more time-consuming restore operations when you need a fresh database copy.
You can use branching with deployment platforms such as Vercel to create a database branch for each preview deployment. If you'd rather not build your own branching workflow, you can use the
Neon Postgres Previews Integration
to set one up in just a few clicks.
To learn more, read
Database Branching Workflows
, and the
Database branching workflow guide for developers
.
Compare database branches with Schema Diff
Neon's Schema Diff tool lets you compare the schemas for two selected branches in a side-by-side view. For more, see
Schema Diff
.
Instant restore
Instant restore with time travel
We've all heard about multi-hour outages and data losses due to errant queries or problematic migrations. Neon's
Instant restore
feature allows you to instantly restore your data to a point in time before the issue occurred. With Neon, you can perform a restore operation in a few clicks, letting you get back online in the time it takes to choose a restore point, which can be a date and time or a
Log Sequence Number (LSN)
.
To help you find the correct restore point, Neon provides a
Time Travel Assist
feature that lets you connect to any selected time or LSN within your database history and run queries. Time Travel Assist is designed to work in tandem with Neon's restore capability to facilitate precise and informed restore operations.
Low-latency connections
Connect from Edge and serverless environments.
The
Neon serverless driver
, which currently has over
300K weekly downloads
, is a low-latency Postgres driver designed for JavaScript and TypeScript applications. It enables you to query data from edge and serverless environments like
Vercel Edge Functions
or
Cloudflare Workers
over HTTP or WebSockets instead of TCP. This capability is particularly useful for achieving reduced query latencies, with the potential to achieve
sub-10ms Postgres query times
when querying from Edge or serverless functions. But don't take our word for it. Try it for yourself with Vercel's
Functions + Database Latency app
. This graph shows latencies for Neon's serverless driver:
Postgres extension support
No database is more extensible than Postgres.
Postgres extensions are add-ons that enhance the functionality of Postgres, letting you tailor your Postgres database to your specific requirements. They offer features ranging from advanced indexing and data types to geospatial capabilities and analytics, allowing you to significantly expand the native capabilities of Postgres. Some of the more popular Postgres extensions include:
PostGIS
: Adds support for geographic objects, turning PostgreSQL into a spatial database.
pg_stat_statements
: Tracks execution statistics of all SQL queries for performance tuning.
pg_partman
: Simplifies partition management, making it easier to maintain time-based or serial-based table partitions.
pg_trgm
: Provides fast similarity search using trigrams, ideal for full-text search.
hstore
: Implements key-value pairs for semi-structured data storage.
plpgsql
: Enables procedural language functions with PL/pgSQL scripting.
pgcrypto
: Offers cryptographic functions, including data encryption and decryption.
pgvector
: Brings vector similarity search to Postgres for building AI applications.
These are just a few of the extensions supported by Neon. Explore all supported extensions
here
.
Extensions can be installed with a simple
CREATE EXTENSION
command from Neon's
SQL Editor
or any SQL client; for example:
CREATE
EXTENSION pgcrypto;
Build your AI applications with Postgres
Why pay for a specialized vector database service when you can just use Postgres?
Neon supports the
pgvector
Postgres extension for storing and retrieving vector embeddings within your Postgres database. This feature is essential for building next-generation AI applications, enabling operations like fast and accurate similarity search, information retrieval, and recommendation systems directly in Postgres. Why pay for or add the complexity of a specialized vector database service when you have leading-edge capabilities in Postgres? Neon's own
Ask Neon AI
chat, built in collaboration with
InKeep
, uses Neon with
pgvector
. For more, see
Powering next gen AI apps with Postgres
.
Database DevOps with Neon's CLI, API, and GitHub Actions
Neon is built for DevOps. Use our CLI, API, or GitHub Actions to build your CI/CD pipelines.
Neon CLI
With the
Neon CLI
, you can integrate Neon with development tools and CI/CD pipelines to enhance your development workflows, reducing the friction associated with database-related operations like creating projects, databases, and branches. Once you have your connection string, you can manage your entire Neon database from the command line. This makes it possible to quickly set up deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Vercel Preview Environments. These operations and pipelines can also be treated as code and live alongside your applications as they evolve and mature.
neon
branches
create
--name
feature/user-auth
Neon API
The
Neon API
is a REST API that enables you to manage your Neon projects programmatically. It provides resource-oriented URLs, accepts request bodies, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. This API allows for a wide range of operations, enabling automation management of various aspects of Neon, including projects, branches, computes, databases, and roles. Like the Neon CLI, you can use the Neon API for seamless integration of Neon's capabilities into automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and developer tools. Give it a try using our

Getting ready for production
A checklist of recommended settings to optimize performance, security, and reliability
Production checklist
0%
1. Set a compute size that can handle production traffic
Make sure your default branch can handle production traffic. A higher minimum compute can help you avoid performance bottlenecks.
2. Enable autoscaling to handle usage spikes
Set your compute to automatically scale up, allowing your app to handle traffic surges and stay performant without manual scaling.
3. Disable scale to zero
Scale to zero turns off your compute after a period of inactivity. Ideal for development or other environments with bursty usage.
4. Use a pooled connection
Increase your database's ability to handle concurrent connections by using connection pooling.
5. Increase your project's restore window to 7 days
Protect your production data from accidental loss. Keep at least a 7-day restore window for quick data recovery and analysis.
6. Restrict database access to trusted IPs
Secure your database by limiting connections to trusted IP addresses.
7. Set up metrics export to Datadog
Export Neon metrics to Datadog and centralize your database monitoring with your existing observability stack.
8. Install pg_stat_statements
Enable query performance monitoring to track execution times and frequency.
9. Ensure your app reconnects after your database restarts
Verify your application handles compute restarts gracefully.
10. Upgrade to get priority support
Get faster support and priority handling for your production database with a Business plan.
11. Advanced: Set up cross-region replication
For added resilience, replicate your data to a Neon project in another region. This helps prepare for regional outages, making it possible to failover to a copy of your database in a different region, if necessary.
Set a compute size that can handle production traffic
Before your application goes to production, make sure your database has enough vCPU and memory to handle expected production load. See
How to size your compute
.
Recommendation
We recommend that you
fit your data in memory
and use Neon
autoscaling
:
Start with a compute size that can hold all your data in memory. Or try to fit at least your most frequently accessed data (your
working set
).
Once you determine the
right size
for your compute, use that as the
minimum compute size
for
Autoscaling
).
About compute size
A Compute Unit (CU) in Neon measures the processing power or "size" of a Neon compute. One CU includes 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM. Neon computes can range from
0.25
CUs to
56
CUs, depending on your
Neon plan
.
Enable autoscaling to handle usage spikes
Use Neon's
autoscaling
feature to dynamically adjust your compute resources based on your current workload. This means you don't need to scale manually during traffic surges.
Recommendation
Minimum compute size
: Autoscaling works best if your data can be fully cached in memory.
Maximum compute size
: Set this to as a high a limit as your plan allows. You only pay for what you use.
To get started with Autoscaling, read:
Enable Autoscaling in Neon
How to size your compute
, including the
Autoscaling considerations
section.
Disable scale to zero
Scale to zero turns off your compute after a period of inactivity. Ideal for development or other environments with bursty usage.
Recommendation
Disable scale to zero for production workloads. This ensures your compute is always active, preventing delays and session context resets caused by cold starts.
Session and latency considerations
By default, your compute scales to zero after 5 minutes. Restarts are nearly instant, but there may still be some latency (around 500 milliseconds depending on the region). Restarts will reset your session context, affecting in-memory statistics and temporary tables. While typical production loads might never go idle long enough to scale to zero, disabling this feature prevents any possible issues from cold starts or session loss.
Disabling scale to zero is available on paid plans only. See
Configuring Scale to Zero for Neon computes
for more detail.
Use a pooled connection
Connection pooling with
PgBouncer
allows your database to handle up to 10,000 concurrent connections, reducing connection overhead and improving performance.
Recommendation
For production environments, enable connection pooling. This increases the number of simultaneous connections your database can handle and optimizes resource usage.
Connection details
Use a pooled connection string by adding
-pooler
to your endpoint ID, or simply copy the pooled connection string from the
Connect
widget in your
Project Dashboard
. Use this string as your database connection in your application's environment variables. For more information, see
Connection pooling
.
Example connection string:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Increase your project's restore window to 7 days
Neon retains a history of changes for all branches, enabling instant restore and time travel queries. This history acts as a backup strategy, allowing recovery of lost data and viewing past database states.
Recommendation
Set your restore window to 7 days to ensure data integrity and quick recovery.
Restore window details
By default, Neon's restore window is set to
1 day
. Extending it to 7 days helps protect you against data loss, letting you recover from human or application errors that may go unnoticed for days. It can also help you comply with any industry regulations that need longer retention periods. While a longer restore window can increase storage costs, it provides exta security and recoverability for production data.
For more info, see
Instant restore
.
Restrict database access to trusted IPs
Neon's IP Allow feature ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to your database, preventing unauthorized access and enhancing security.
Recommendation
Combine an allowlist with protected branches for enhanced security. This setup ensures that only trusted IPs can access critical data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and safeguarding data integrity.
Configuration details
IP Allow
: Restricts access to specific, trusted IP addresses, preventing unauthorized connections.
Protected branch
: Safeguards critical data from accidental deletions or modifications by designating branches as protected.
Available with the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plans, you can configure
IP Allow
and protected branches in your Neon project's settings. For more information, see
Configure IP Allow
and
Protected branches guide
.
Set up metrics export to Datadog
Export Neon metrics to DataDog and centralize your database monitoring with your existing observability stack.
Recommendation
Set up Datadog integration to monitor and set alerts for key metrics:
Connection counts (active and idle database connections)
Database size (total size of all databases)
Replication delay (lag in bytes and seconds)
Compute metrics (CPU and memory usage)
For more information, see
The Neon Datadog integration
.
Ensure your app reconnects after your database restarts
Verify your application handles compute restarts gracefully. Neon occasionally restarts computes for updates and maintenance.
Recommendation
Most database drivers and connection pools handle reconnection automatically, but it's important to test this behavior. You can use the Neon API to trigger a restart and watch your application reconnect:
curl
--request
POST
\
--url
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/your_project_id/endpoints/your_endpoint_id/restart
\
--header
'accept: application/json'
\
--header
'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
See
Restart compute endpoint
for details.
For more information:
Build connection timeout handling into your application
Maintenance & updates overview
Install pg_stat_statements
Enable query performance monitoring to track execution times and frequency.
Recommendation
Install the
pg_stat_statements
extension to monitor query performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
Usage
CREATE
EXTENSION
IF
NOT
EXISTS
pg_stat_statements;
The statistics gathered by this extension require little overhead and let you quickly access metrics like:
Most frequently executed queries
Longest running queries
Queries that return the most rows
You can also use the
Monitoring Dashboard
in the Neon Console to view live graphs for system and database metrics like CPU, RAM, and connections.
For more information, see
Query performance
and
Monitoring
.
Upgrade to a Neon Business plan for priority support
Support tickets opened by Business and Enterprise support plan customers are given top priority by the Neon Support team.
Recommendation
Upgrade to a
Business plan
to get both
Priority support
and acccess to the
Business SLA
.
For more information, see the
Support documentation
.
Advanced: Set up cross-region replication
Cross-region replication can provide an added layer of resilience for production environments. It allows you to replicate data from one Neon project to another in a different region — helping you prepare for unlikely regional outages or implement failover strategies.
Recommendation
Set up cross-region replication if your app requires high availability across regions or if you're building a disaster recovery plan.
How it works
Neon uses
logical replication
to replicate data between Neon projects. You can replicate from a source project in one region to a destination project in another region, creating a near real-time copy of your data.
Steps to get started
Set up a publication on your source database
Create matching tables and a subscription on your destination database
Test the replication and monitor for consistency
For full details, see
Replicate data from one Neon project to another

You can stop paying for compute resources that you only use sometimes
. You no longer have to run a maximum potential load configuration at all times.
No more manual scaling disruptions
. With autoscaling, you can focus more on your application and less on managing infrastructure.

Autoscaling
guide.
Scale to zero
Stop paying for idle databases.
Neon's
Scale to zero
feature automatically transitions a Neon compute (where Postgres runs) to an idle state when it is not being used, effectively scaling it to zero to minimize compute usage and costs.
Why do you need a database that scales to zero?
Combined with Neon's branching capability, scale to zero allows you to instantly spin up databases for development, experimentation, or testing without the typical costs associated with "always-running" databases with relatively little usage. This approach is ideal for various scenarios:
Non-production databases
: Development, staging, and testing environments benefit as developers can work on multiple instances without cost concerns since these databases only use resources when active.
Internal apps
: These apps often experience downtime during off-hours or holidays. Scale to zero ensures that supporting databases pause during inactivity, cutting costs without affecting usage during active periods.
Small projects
: Implementing scale to zero for these projects' databases enhances cost efficiency without significantly impacting user experience.

A storage architecture built for the cloud
Efficient, performant, reliable storage
Neon's storage was built for high availability and durability. Every transaction is stored in multiple copies across availability zones and cloud object storage.Efficiency and performance are achieved through a multi-tier architecture designed to balance latency, throughput, and cost considerations.
Neon storage is architected to integrate storage, backups, and archiving into one system to reduce operational headaches and administrative overhead associated with checkpoints, data backups, and restore.
Neon uses cloud-based object storage solutions, such as Amazon S3, to relocate less frequently accessed data to the most cost-efficient storage option. For your most frequently accessed data, which requires rapid access and high throughput, Neon uses locally attached SSDs to ensure high performance and low latency.
The entire Neon storage framework is developed in Rust for maximum performance and usability. Read about
how we scale an open source, multi-tenant storage engine for Postgres written in Rust
, or [take a deep dive into the Neon storage engine](/blog/get-page-a(/blognder, Heikki Linnakangas.
Change Data Capture (CDC) with Logical Replication
Stream your data to external data platforms and services.
Neon's Logical Replication feature enables replicating data from your Neon database to external destinations, allowing for Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. Stream your data to data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, external Postgres databases, and more. To learn more, see
Get started with logical replication
.
You can also replicate data to Neon from other Postgres platforms and instances. See our
logical replication migration guides
to get started.
Scale with read replicas
Add read replicas to achieve instant scale.
Neon supports read replicas that let you instantly scale your application by offloading read-only workloads from your primary read-write compute.
Create a read replica with the Neon CLI:
neon
branches
create
--name
my_read_replica_branch
--type
read_only
To learn more, see
Read replicas
.
Support for thousands of connections
Add support for thousands of concurrent connections with a pooled connection string.
Neon's
connection pooling
feature supports up to 10,000 concurrent connections. Connection pooling works by caching and reusing database connections, which helps to significantly optimize resource usage and enhance performance. It reduces the overhead associated with establishing new connections and closing old ones, allowing applications to handle a higher volume of requests more efficiently. Neon uses
PgBouncer
to support connection pooling. Enabling connection pooling is easy. Just grab a pooled connection string from the console:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname

Query with Neon's SQL Editor
Query your database from the Neon Console using the Neon SQL Editor
The Neon SQL Editor allows you to run queries on your Neon databases directly from the Neon Console. In addition, the editor keeps a query history, permits saving queries, and provides
Explain
and
Analyze
features.
To use the SQL Editor:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select your project.
Select
SQL Editor
.
Select a branch and database.
Enter a query into the editor and click
Run
to view the results.
You can use the following query to try the SQL Editor. The query creates a table, adds data, and retrieves the data from the table.
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
SELECT
*
FROM
playing_with_neon;
Running multiple query statements at once returns a separate result set for each statement. The result sets are displayed in separate tabs, numbered in order of execution, as shown above.
To clear the editor, click
New Query
.
tip
When querying objects such as tables and columns with upper case letters in their name, remember to enclose the identifier name in quotes. For example:
SELECT * FROM "Company"
. Postgres changes identifier names to lower case unless they are quoted. The same applies when creating objects in Postgres. For example,
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT(id INT)
creates a table named
department
in Postgres. For more information about how quoted and unquoted identifiers are treated by Postgres, see
Identifiers and Key Words
, in the
PostgreSQL documentation
.
Save your queries
The SQL Editor allows you to save your queries.
To save a query:
Enter the query into the editor.
Click
Save
to open the
SAVE QUERY
dialog.
Enter a name for the query and click
Save
.
The query is added to the
Saved
list in the left pane of the SQL Editor. You can rerun a query by selecting it from the
Saved
list.
You can rename or delete a saved query by selecting
Rename
or
Delete
from the more options menu associated with the saved query.
View the query history
The SQL Editor maintains a query history for the project. To view your query history, select
History
in the left pane of the SQL Editor. You can click an item in the
History
list to view the query that was run.
note
Queries saved to
History
are limited to 9 KB in length. While you can execute longer queries from the SQL Editor, any query exceeding 9 KB will be truncated when saved. A
-- QUERY TRUNCATED
comment is added at the beginning of these queries to indicate truncation. Additionally, if you input a query longer than 9 KB in the Neon SQL Editor, a warning similar to the following will appear:
This query will still run, but the last 1234 characters will be truncated from query history
.
Explain and Analyze
The Neon SQL Editor provides
Explain
and
Analyze
features.
The
Explain
feature runs the specified query with the Postgres
EXPLAIN
command, which returns the execution plan for the query. The
Explain
feature only returns a plan with estimates. It does not execute the query.
The
Analyze
feature runs the specified query with
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
. The
ANALYZE
parameter causes the query to be executed and returns actual row counts and run times for plan nodes along with the
EXPLAIN
estimates.
Understanding the information provided by the
Explain
and
Analyze
features requires familiarity with the Postgres
EXPLAIN
command and its
ANALYZE
parameter. Refer to the
EXPLAIN
documentation and the
Using EXPLAIN
topic in the
PostgreSQL documentation
.
Time Travel
You can toggle Time Travel in the SQL Editor to switch from querying your current data to querying against a selected point within your
restore window
.
For more details about using Time Travel queries, see:
Time Travel
Time Travel tutorial
Export data to CSV, JSON and XLSX
The Neon SQL Editor supports exporting your data to
JSON
,
CSV
and
XLSX
. You can access the download button from the bottom right corner of the
SQL Editor
page. The download button only appears when there is a result set to download.
Expand results section of the SQL Editor window
You can expand the results section of the SQL Editor window by selecting the expand window button from the bottom right corner of the
SQL Editor
page. There must be query results to display, otherwise the expanded results section will appear blank.
Meta-commands
The Neon SQL Editor supports using Postgres meta-commands, which act like shortcuts for interacting with your database. If you are already familiar with using meta-commands from the
psql
command-line interface, you can use many of those same commands in the SQL Editor.
Benefits of Meta-Commands
Meta-commands can significantly speed up your workflow by providing quick access to database schemas and other critical information without needing to write full SQL queries. They are especially useful for database management tasks, making it easier to handle administrative duties directly from the Neon Console.
Available meta-commands
Here are some of the meta-commands that you can use within the Neon SQL Editor:
\dt
— List all tables in the current database.
\d [table_name]
— Describe a table's structure.
\l
— List all databases.
\?
- A cheat sheet of available meta-commands
\h [NAME]
- Get help for any Postgres command. For example, try
\h SELECT
.
Note that not all meta-commands are supported in the SQL Editor. To get a list of supported commands, use
\?

How to Use Meta-Commands
To use a meta-command in the SQL Editor:
Enter the meta-command in the editor, just like you would a SQL query.
Press
Run
. The result of the meta-command will be displayed in the output pane, similar to how SQL query results are shown.
For example, here's the schema for the
playing_with_neon
table we created above, using the meta-command
\d playing_with_neon
:
AI features
The Neon SQL Editor offers three AI-driven features:
SQL generation
: Easily convert natural language requests to SQL. Press the ✨ button or
Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M
, type your request, and the AI assistant will generate the corresponding SQL for you. It’s schema-aware, meaning you can reference any table names, functions, or other objects in your schema.
Fix with AI
: If your query returns an error, simply click
Fix with AI
next to the error message. The AI assistant will analyze the error, suggest a fix, and update the SQL Editor so you can run the query again.
AI-generated query names
: Descriptive names are automatically assigned to your queries in the Neon SQL Editor's
History
. This feature helps you quickly identify and reuse previously executed queries.
important
To enhance your experience with the Neon SQL Editor's AI features, we share your database schema with the AI agent. No actual data is shared. We currently use AWS Bedrock as our LLM provider, ensuring all requests remain within AWS's secure infrastructure where other Neon resources are also managed.
There is a maximum limit of 5 AI requests every 60 seconds.

Branching workflows
Connect Neon to your stack
This tutorial walks you through your first steps using Neon as your Postgres database. You'll explore the Neon object hierarchy and learn how database branching can simplify your development workflow.
About branching
Each
branch
is a fully-isolated copy of its parent. We suggest creating a long-term branch for each developer on your team to maintain consistent connection strings. You can reset your development branch to production whenever needed.
After signing up, you'll start with two branches:
A
production
branch (the default branch) intended for your production workload, configured with a larger compute size (1-4 CU)
A
development
branch (created as a child of production) that you can use for local development, configured with a smaller compute size (0.25-1 CU)
You can change these sizes at any time, but these are meant to align with typical usage, where production will need more compute than your less active development branches.
Sign up
If you're already signed up or coming to Neon from
Azure
, you can skip ahead to
Step 2

Neon Free Plan
. For information about Neon's paid options, see
Neon Plans
.
Onboarding in the Neon Console
After you sign up, you are guided through some onboarding steps that ask you to create a
Project
.
The steps should be self-explanatory, but it's important to understand a few key points:
In Neon, everything starts with the
Project
It is the top-level container that holds your branches, databases, and roles. Typically, you should create a project for each repository in your application. This allows you to manage your database branches just like you manage your code branches: a branch for production, staging, development, new features, previews, and so forth.
We create two branches for you
production
is the default (primary) branch and hosts your database, role, and a compute that you can connect your application to
development
is created as a child branch of production for your development work
At this point, if you want to just get started connecting Neon to your toolchain, go to
Day 2 - Connecting Neon to your tools
. Or if you want a more detailed walkthrough of some of our key console and branching features, let's keep going.
Add sample data
Let's get familiar with the
SQL Editor
, where you can run queries against your databases directly from the Neon Console, as well as access more advanced features like
Time Travel
and
Explain and Analyze
.
From the Neon Console, use the sidebar navigation to open the
SQL Editor
page. Notice that your default branch
production
is already selected, along with the database created during onboarding,
neondb
.
The first time you open the SQL Editor for a new project, the editor includes placeholder SQL commands to create and populate a new sample table called
playing_with_neon
.
For this tutorial, go ahead and create this sample table: click
Run
.
Every query you run in the SQL Editor is automatically saved with an AI-generated description, making it easy to find and reference your work later. For example, the sample table creation above will be saved with a description like "create and populate sample table in Neon". You can view your query history anytime by clicking the
History
button in the SQL Editor.
Or if you want to add the table from the command line and you already have
psql
installed:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
Your default branch
production
now has a table with some data.
Try the AI Assistant
Now that you have some sample data, let's explore how the AI Assistant can help you write SQL queries using natural language prompts.
From the SQL Editor, click the
AI Assistant
button in the top-right corner and try a few prompts:
Add three more rows to the playing_with_neon table with tech company names
Show me the highest value in the table
Calculate the average value grouped by the first letter of the name
Each query you run is automatically saved with an AI-generated description, making it easy to find and reuse queries later. For example, when you ask the AI Assistant to add company data, you should see a response like:
-- Text to SQL original prompt:
-- Add three more rows to the playing_with_neon table with tech company names
INSERT INTO
public.playing_with_neon (
name
,
value
)
VALUES
(
'Google'
,
1000
.
5
),
(
'Apple'
,
1200
.
75
),
(
'Microsoft'
,
950
.
25
);
With the description: "Add tech companies to playing_with_neon table"
Learn more about AI features in the
SQL Editor documentation
.
View and modify data in the console
Now that you have some data to play with, let's take a look at it on the
Tables
page in the Neon Console. The
Tables
page, powered by
Drizzle Studio
, provides a visual interface for exploring and modifying data directly from the console. The integration with Drizzle Studio provides the ability to add, update, and delete records, filter data, add or remove columns, drop or truncate tables, and export data in
.json
and
.csv
formats.
For a detailed guide on how to interact with your data using the
Tables
page, visit
Managing your data with interactive tables
.
Working with your development branch
Your project comes with a
development
branch that's an isolated copy of your
production
branch. Let's learn how to use the Neon CLI to manage branches and make some schema changes in your development environment.
Install CLI with Brew or NPM
Depending on your system, you can install the Neon CLI using either Homebrew (for macOS) or NPM (for other platforms).
For macOS using Homebrew:
brew
install
neonctl
Using NPM (applicable for all platforms that support Node.js):
npm
install
-g
neonctl
Authenticate with Neon
The
neon auth
command launches a browser window where you can authorize the Neon CLI to access your Neon account.
neon
auth
View your branches
neon
branches
list
This command shows your existing branches, including the
production
and
development
branches.
Make some sample schema changes
First, let's make sure our development branch is in sync with production. This ensures we're starting from the same baseline:
neon
branches
reset
development
--parent
Now that our development branch matches production, we can make some changes. The
playing_with_neon
table from production is now available in your
development
branch, and we'll modify its schema and add new data to demonstrate how branches can diverge.
You can use the
Neon SQL Editor
for this, but let's demonstrate how to connect and modify your database from the terminal using
psql
. If you don't have
psql
installed already, follow these steps to get set up:
Mac
Linux
Windows
brew
install
libpq
echo
'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"'
>>
~/.zshrc
source
~/.zshrc
With
psql
available, let's work from the terminal to connect to your
development
branch's database and make changes.
Connect to your database
Get the connection string to your branch and connect to it directly via
psql
:
neon
connection-string
development
--database-name
neondb
--psql
This command establishes the psql terminal connection to the
neondb
database on your development branch.
Modify the schema
Add a new column
description
and index it:
ALTER
TABLE
playing_with_neon
ADD
COLUMN
description
TEXT
;
CREATE
INDEX
idx_playing_with_neon_description
ON
playing_with_neon (
description
);
Insert new data
Add new data that will be exclusive to the dev branch.
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon (
name
,
description
)
VALUES
(
'Your dev branch'
,
'Exploring schema changes in the dev branch'
);
Verify the schema changes
Query the table to verify your schema changes:
SELECT
*
FROM
playing_with_neon;
Your response should include the new description column and a new row where name =
Your dev branch
and description =
Exploring schema changes in the dev branch

Check your changes with Schema Diff
After making the schema changes to your development branch, you can use the
Schema Diff
feature to compare your branch against its parent branch. Schema Diff is a GitHub-style code-comparison tool used to visualize differences between different branch's databases.
For this tutorial, Schema Diff helps with validating isolation: it confirms that schema changes made in your isolated development branch remain separate from the production branch.
From the
Branches
page in the Neon Console:
Open the detailed view for your
development
branch and click
Open schema diff
.
Verify the right branches are selected and click
Compare
. You can see the schema changes we added to our development branch highlighted in green.
Schema Migrations
A more typical scenario for Schema Diff is when preparing for schema migrations. While Neon does not provide built-in schema migration tools, you can use ORMs like
Drizzle
or
Prisma
to handle schema migrations efficiently. Read more about using Neon in your development workflow in
Connect Neon to your stack
.
Reset your development branch to production
After experimenting with changes in your development branch, let's now reset the branch to
production
, its parent branch.
Branch reset
functions much like a
git reset –hard parent
in traditional Git workflows.
Resetting your development branches to your production branch ensures that all changes are discarded, and your branch reflects the latest stable state of
production
. This is key to maintaining a clean slate for new development tasks and is one of the core advantages of Neon's branching capabilities.
You can reset to parent from the
Branches
page of the Neon Console, but here we'll use the Neon CLI.
Use the following command to reset your
development
branch to the state of the
production
branch:
Example:
neon
branches
reset
development
--parent
If you go back to your
Schema Diff
and compare branches again, you'll see they are now identical:
When to reset your branch
Depending on your development workflow, you can use branch reset:
After a feature is completed and merged
Once your changes are merged into
production
, reset the development branch to start on the next feature.
When you need to abandon changes
If a project direction changes or if experimental changes are no longer needed, resetting the branch quickly reverts to a known good state.
As part of your CI/CD automation
With the Neon CLI, you can include branch reset as an enforced part of your CI/CD automation, automatically resetting a branch when a feature is closed or started.
Make sure that your development team is always working from the latest schema and data by including branch reset in your workflow. To read more about using branching in your workflows, see

Why Neon?
Neon is Serverless Postgres built for the cloud
Looking back at Neon's debut blog post,
SELECT ’Hello, World’
, the fundamental reasons for
Why Neon
remain the same:
To build the best Postgres experience in the cloud
This is still our core mission today. It was clear to us then, as it is now, that database workloads are shifting to the cloud — and no one wants to manage a database themselves.
In an ever-changing technology stack, we believe Postgres is here to stay
Just like the Linux operating system or Git version control, we believe Postgres is the default choice for a relational database system. That’s why all of the major platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, and many newcomers to this space offer Postgres as a service.
An idea that a modern Postgres cloud service can be designed differently
We call this approach
separation of storage and compute
, which lets us architect the service around performance, reliability, manageability, and cost-efficiency.
The belief that our architecture can provide a better Developer Experience (DevX)
Features such as autoscaling, branching, time travel, instant provisioning, and instant restore improve the developer experience by allowing quick environment setup, efficient developer workflows, and immediate database availability.
These are Neon's reasons, but given the many
database-as-a-service
options available today, let's take a look at the reasons why
you
should choose Neon:
Neon is Postgres
Postgres is the world's most popular open-source database.
From its beginning as a
DARPA-sponsored project at Berkeley
, Postgres has fostered an ever-growing community and is a preferred database among developers because of its performance, reliability, extensibility, and support for features like ACID transactions, advanced SQL, and NoSQL/JSON. Neon supports all of the latest Postgres versions and numerous
Postgres extensions
.

Neon is serverless
A serverless architecture built for performance, reliability, manageability, and cost efficiency
Neon's
architecture
separates compute from storage, which enables serverless features like instant provisioning,
autoscaling
,
scale to zero
, and more.
Separating compute from storage refers to an architecture where the database computation processes (queries, transactions, etc.) are handled by one set of resources (compute), while the data itself is stored on a separate set of resources (storage). This design contrasts with traditional architectures where compute and storage are tightly coupled on the same server. In Neon, Postgres runs on a compute, and data (except for what's cached in local compute memory) resides on Neon's storage layer.
Separation of compute and storage allows these resources to be scaled independently. You can adjust for processing power or storage capacity as needed without affecting the other. This approach is also cost-efficient. The ability to scale resources independently means you can benefit from the lower cost of storage compared to compute or avoid paying for additional storage when you only require extra processing power. Decoupling compute and storage also improves availability and durability, as data remains accessible and safe, even if a compute fails.
Read more about the benefits of Neon's serverless architecture
and how it supports database-per-user architectures, variable workloads, database branching workflows, and
AI agents
.
Did you know?
Neon's autoscaling feature instantly scales your compute and memory resources.
No manual intervention or restarts are required.
Neon is fully managed
Leave the database administrative, maintenance, and scaling burdens to us.
Being a fully managed service means that Neon provides high availability without requiring users to handle administrative, maintenance, or scaling burdens associated with managing a database system. This approach allows developers to focus more on developing applications and less on the operational aspects of database management. Neon takes care of the complexities of scaling, backups, maintenance, and ensuring availability, enabling developers to manage their data without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
Neon is open source
Neon is developed under an Apache 2.0 license.
Neon is not the first to offer separation of storage and compute for Postgres. AWS Aurora is probably the most famous example — but it's proprietary and tied to AWS’s internal infrastructure.
We believe we have an opportunity to define the standard for cloud Postgres. We carefully designed our storage, focusing on cloud independence, performance, manageability, DevX, and cost. We chose the most permissive open-source license, Apache 2.0, and invited the world to participate. You can already build and run your own self-hosted instance of Neon. Check out our
neon GitHub repository
and the
#self-hosted
channel on our Discord server.
Neon doesn't lock you in
As a true Postgres platform, there's no lock-in with Neon.
Building on Neon is building on Postgres. If you are already running Postgres, getting started is easy.
Import your data
and
connect
. Migrating from other databases like MySQL or MongoDB is just as easy.
If you need to move data, you won't have to tear apart your application to remove proprietary application layers. Neon is pro-ecosystem and pro-integration. We encourage you to build with the frameworks, platforms, and services that best fit your requirements. Neon works to enable that. Check out our ever-expanding collection of
framework
,
language
, and
integration
guides.

Database branching workflow primer
An introduction to integrating Postgres branching into your development workflow
With Neon, you can work with your data just like you work with your code. The key is Neon's database
branching
feature, which lets you instantly create branches of your data that you can include in your workflow — as many branches as you need.
Neon branches are:
Isolated
: changes made to a branch don't affect its parent.
Fast to create
: creating a branch takes ~1 second, regardless of the size of your database.
Cost-effective
: you're only billed for unique data across all branches, and they scale to zero when not in use (you can configure this behavior for every branch).
Ready to use
: branches will have the parent branch's schema and all its data (you can also include data up to a certain point in time). If you're working with sensitive data, Neon also supports a
schema-only branching
option.
Every Neon branch has a unique Postgres connection string, so they're completely isolated from one another.
# Branch 1
postgresql://database_name_owner:AbC123dEf@ep-shiny-cell-a5y2zuu0.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
# Branch 2
postgresql://database_name_owner:AbC123dEf@ep-hidden-hall-a5x58cuv.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
You can create all of your branches from the default branch, or set up a dedicated branch that you use as a base. The first approach is simpler, while the second provides greater data isolation.
Create branch methods
You can use either the Neon CLI or GitHub actions to incorporate branching into your workflow.
Neon CLI
Using the
Neon CLI
, you can create branches without leaving your editor or automate branch creation in your CI/CD pipeline.
And here are the key CLI actions you can use:
# Create branch
neon
branches
create
[options]
# Get Connection string
neon
connection-string
[branch] [options]
# Delete branch
neon
branches
delete
<
id
|
name
> [options]

GitHub Actions
If you're using GitHub Actions for your CI workflows, Neon provides GitHub Actions for
creating
,
deleting
, and
resetting
branches — and there's also a
schema diff action
.

A branch for every environment
Here's how you can integrate Neon branching into your workflow:
Development
You can create a Neon branch for every developer on your team. This ensures that every developer has an isolated environment that includes schemas and data. These branches are meant to be long-lived, so each developer can tailor their branch based on their needs. With Neon's
branch reset capability
, developers can refresh their branch with the latest schemas and data anytime they need.
tip
To easily identify branches dedicated to development, we recommend prefixing the branch name with
dev/<developer-name>
or
dev/<feature-name>
if multiple developers collaborate on the same development branch.
Examples:
dev/alice
dev/new-onboarding
Preview environments
Whenever you create a pull request, you can create a Neon branch for your preview deployment. This allows you to test your code changes and SQL migrations against production-like data.
tip
We recommend following this naming convention to identify these branches easily:
preview/pr-
<pull_request_number>-<git_branch_name>
Example:
preview/pr-123-feat/new-login-screen
You can also automate branch creation for every preview. These example applications show how to create Neon branches with GitHub Actions for every preview environment.
Preview branches with Fly.io
Sample project showing you how to create a branch for every Fly.io preview deployment
Preview branches with Vercel
Sample project showing you how to create a branch for every Vercel preview deployment
Testing
When running automated tests that require a database, each test run can have its branch with its own compute resources. You can create a branch at the start of a test run and delete it at the end.
tip
We recommend following this naming convention to identify these branches easily:
test/
<git_branch_name-test_run_name-commit_SHA-time_of_the_test_execution>
The time of the test execution can be an epoch UNIX timestamp (e.g., 1704305739). For example:
test/feat/new-login-loginPageFunctionality-1a2b3c4d-20240211T1530
You can create test branches from the same date and time or Log Sequence Number (LSN) for tests requiring static or deterministic data.

Authenticate Neon Postgres application users with Auth0
Learn how to add authentication to a Neon Postgres database application using Auth0
User authentication is an essential part of most web applications. Modern apps often require features like social login, multi-factor authentication, and secure user data management that complies with privacy regulations.
Auth0
is an authentication and authorization platform that provides these features out of the box. It offers SDKs for popular web frameworks, making it straightforward to integrate with your application backed by a Neon Postgres database.
In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a simple Next.js application using Neon Postgres as the database, and add user authentication using
Auth0
. We will cover how to:
Set up a Next.js project with Auth0 for authentication
Create a Neon Postgres database and connect it to your application
Define a database schema using Drizzle ORM and generate migrations
Store and retrieve user data associated with Auth0 user IDs
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
An
Auth0
account for user authentication. Auth0 provides a free plan to get started.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Initialize your Next.js project
We will create a simple web app that lets you add a favorite quote to the home page, and edit it afterward. Run the following command in your terminal to create a new
Next.js
project:
npx
create-next-app
guide-neon-next-auth0
--typescript
--eslint
--tailwind
--use-npm
--no-src-dir
--app
--import-alias
"@/*"
Now, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
drizzle-orm
npm
install
-D
drizzle-kit
dotenv
npm
install
@auth0/nextjs-auth0
We use the
@neondatabase/serverless
package as the Postgres client, and
drizzle-orm
, a lightweight typescript ORM, to interact with the database.
@auth0/nextjs-auth0
is the Auth0 SDK for Next.js applications. We also use
dotenv
to manage environment variables and the
drizzle-kit
CLI tool for generating database migrations.
Also, add a
.env.local
file to the root of your project, which we'll use to store Neon/Auth0 connection parameters:
touch
.env.local
note
At the time of this post, the
@auth0/nextjs-auth0
package caused import errors related to one of its dependencies (
oauth4webapi
). To stop Next.js from raising the error, add the following to your
nextjs.config.mjs
file:
/**
@type
{import('next').NextConfig}
*/
const
nextConfig
=
{
experimental
:
{ esmExternals
:
'loose'
}
,
};
export
default
nextConfig;
Now, we can start building the application.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select an existing project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Choose the desired region and Postgres version for your project, then click
Create Project
.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Add this connection string to the
.env.local
file in your Next.js project.
# .env.local
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
Configuring Auth0 for authentication
Create an Auth0 application
Log in to your Auth0 account and navigate to the
Dashboard
. From the left sidebar, select
Applications > Create Application
to create a new app.
In the dialog that appears, provide a name for your application, select
Regular Web Applications
as the application type, and click
Create
.
Configure Auth0 application settings
In the
Settings
tab of your Auth0 application, scroll down to the
Application URIs
section.
Set the
Allowed Callback URLs
to
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
for local development.
Set the
Allowed Logout URLs
to
http://localhost:3000
.
Click
Save Changes
at the bottom of the page.
Retrieve your Auth0 domain and client ID
From the
Settings
tab of your Auth0 application, copy the
Domain
and
Client ID
values. Add these to the
.env.local
file in your Next.js project:
# .env.local
AUTH0_SECRET
=
'random-32-byte-value'
AUTH0_BASE_URL
=
'http://localhost:3000'
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL
=
'https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN'
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
=
'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
=
'YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'
Replace
YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
,
YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
and
YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET
with the actual values from your Auth0 application settings.
Run the following command in your terminal to generate a random 32-byte value for the
AUTH0_SECRET
variable:
node
-e
"console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
Implementing the application
Define your database connection and schema
Create a
db
folder inside the
app/
directory. This is where we'll define the database schema and connection code.
Now, add the file
app/db/index.ts
with the following content:
/// app/db/index.ts
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ UserMessages }
from
'./schema'
;
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
) {
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL must be a Neon postgres connection string'
);
}
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
export
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql
,
{
schema
:
{ UserMessages }
,
});
This exports a
db
instance that we can use to execute queries against the Neon database.
Next, create a
schema.ts
file inside the
app/db
directory to define the database schema:
/// app/db/schema.ts
import
{ pgTable
,
text
,
timestamp }
from
'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
;
export
const
UserMessages
=
pgTable
(
'user_messages'
,
{
user_id
:
text
(
'user_id'
)
.primaryKey
()
.notNull
()
,
createTs
:
timestamp
(
'create_ts'
)
.defaultNow
()
.notNull
()
,
message
:
text
(
'message'
)
.notNull
()
,
});
This schema defines a table
user_messages
to store a message for each user, with the
user_id
provided by Auth0 as the primary key.
Generate and run migrations
We'll use the
drizzle-kit
CLI tool to generate migrations for the schema we defined. To configure how it connects to the database, add a
drizzle.config.ts
file at the project root.
/// drizzle.config.ts
import
type
{ Config }
from
'drizzle-kit'
;
import
*
as
dotenv
from
'dotenv'
;
dotenv
.config
({ path
:
'.env.local'
});
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
)
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL not found in environment'
);
export
default
{
schema
:
'./app/db/schema.ts'
,
out
:
'./drizzle'
,
dialect
:
'postgresql'
,
dbCredentials
:
{
url
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
}
,
strict
:
true
,
}
satisfies
Config
;
Now, generate the migration files by running the following command:
npx
drizzle-kit
generate
This will create a
drizzle
folder at the project root with the migration files. To apply the migration to the database, run:
npx
drizzle-kit
push
The
user_messages
table will now be visible in the Neon console.
Configure Auth0 authentication
We create a
dynamic route
to handle the Auth0 authentication flow. Create a new file
app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts
with the following content:
/// app/api/auth/[auth0]/route.ts
import
{ handleAuth
,
handleLogin }
from
'@auth0/nextjs-auth0'
;
export
default
handleAuth
({
login
:
handleLogin
()
,
});
This sets up the necesssary Auth0 authentication routes for the application at the
/api/auth/auth0/*
endpoints -
login
,
logout
,
callback
(to redirect to after a successful login), and
me
(to fetch the user profile).
Next, we will wrap the application with the
UserProvider
component from
@auth0/nextjs-auth0
, so all pages have access to the current user context. Replace the contents of the
app/layout.tsx
file with the following:
/// app/layout.tsx
import
type
{ Metadata }
from
'next'
;
import
{ Inter }
from
'next/font/google'
;
import
'./globals.css'
;
import
{ getSession }
from
'@auth0/nextjs-auth0'
;
import
{ UserProvider }
from
'@auth0/nextjs-auth0/client'
;
const
inter
=
Inter
({ subsets
:
[
'latin'
] });
export
const
metadata
:

=
{
title

'Neon-Next-Auth0 guide'
,

};
async

if
(

}
const
{

return
(

}
Add interactivity to the application
Our application has a single page that lets the logged-in user store their favorite quote and displays it. We implement
Next.js
server actions to handle the form submission and database interaction.
Create a new file at
app/actions.ts
with the following content:
/// app/actions.ts
'use server'
;
import
{ getSession }
from
'@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge'
;
import
{ UserMessages }
from
'./db/schema'
;
import
{ db }
from
'./db'
;
import
{ redirect }
from
'next/navigation'
;
import
{ eq }
from
'drizzle-orm'
;
export
async
function
createUserMessage
(formData
:
FormData
) {
const
session
=
await
getSession
();
if
(
!
session)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not authenticated'
);
const
message
=
formData
.get
(
'message'
)
as
string
;
await
db
.insert
(UserMessages)
.values
({
user_id
:
session
.
user
.sub
,
message
,
});
redirect
(
'/'
);
}
export
async
function
deleteUserMessage
() {
const
session
=
await
getSession
();
if
(
!
session)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not authenticated'
);
await
db
.delete
(UserMessages)
.where
(
eq
(
UserMessages
.user_id
,
session
.
user
.sub));
redirect
(
'/'
);
}
The
createUserMessage
function inserts a new message into the
user_messages
table, while
deleteUserMessage
removes the message associated with the current user.
Next, we implement a minimal UI to interact with these functions. Replace the contents of the
app/page.tsx
file with the following:
/// app/page.tsx
import
{ createUserMessage
,
deleteUserMessage }
from
'./actions'
;
import
{ db }
from
'./db'
;
import
{ getSession }
from
'@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge'
;
async
function
getUserMessage
() {
const
session
=
await
getSession
();
if
(
!
session)
return
null
;
return
db
.
query
.
UserMessages
.findFirst
({
where
:
(messages
,
{ eq })
=>
eq
(
messages
.user_id
,
session
.
user
.sub)
,
});
}

);
}
This implements a form with a single text field that lets the user input a quote, and submit it, whereby it gets stored in the database, associated with their
Auth0
user ID. If a quote is already stored, it displays the quote and provides a button to delete it.
The
getSession
function from
@auth0/nextjs-auth0/edge
provides the current user's session information, which we use to interact with the database on their behalf. If the user is not authenticated, the page displays a login button instead.
Running the application
To start the application, run the following command:
npm
run
dev
This will start the Next.js development server. Open your browser and navigate to
http://localhost:3000
to see the application in action. When running for the first time, you'll be prompted to log in with Auth0. By default, Auth0 provides email and Google account as login options.
Once authenticated, you'll be able to visit the home page, add a quote, and see it displayed.
Conclusion
In this guide, we walked through setting up a simple Next.js application with user authentication using Auth0 and a Neon Postgres database. We defined a database schema using Drizzle ORM, generated migrations, and interacted with the database to store and retrieve user data.
Next, we can add more routes and features to the application. The
UserProvider
component from
@auth0/nextjs-auth0
provides the user context to each page, allowing you to conditionally render content based on the user's authentication state.
To view and manage the users who authenticated with your application, you can navigate to the
Auth0 Dashboard
and click on
User Management > Users
in the sidebar. Here, you can see the list of users who have logged in and perform any necessary actions for those users.

Authenticate Neon Postgres application users with Auth.js
Learn how to add passwordless authentication to your Neon Postgres database application using Auth.js and Resend
Did you know?
We recently introduced an Auth.js adapter for Neon, making it easier to store user and session data in Neon. For installation and setup instructions, see
Neon Adapter
.
Auth.js
(formerly NextAuth.js) is a popular authentication solution that supports a wide range of authentication methods, including social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook), traditional email/password, and passwordless options like magic links. For simple authentication flows, such as social logins, Auth.js can operate using only in-memory session storage (in a browser cookie). However, if you want to implement custom login flows, or persist the signed-in users' information in your database, you need to specify a database backend.
For example, passwordless authentication methods like magic links require secure storage of temporary tokens. Magic link login has become increasingly popular since it eliminates the need for users to remember complex passwords, reducing the risk of credential-based attacks.
In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a simple Next.js application, using Neon Postgres as the database backend for both Auth.js authentication and application data. We'll use
Resend
for sending magic link emails. We will cover how to:
Set up a Next.js project with Auth.js for magic link authentication
Create a Neon Postgres database and configure it as the Auth.js database backend
Configure Resend as an authentication provider
Implement a basic authenticated feature (a simple todo list)
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. We'll use a database named
neondb
in the following examples.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
A
Resend
account for sending emails. Resend offers a free tier to get started.
A domain
Initialize your Next.js project
Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Next.js project:
npx
create-next-app
guide-neon-next-authjs
--typescript
--eslint
--tailwind
--use-npm
--no-src-dir
--app
--import-alias
"@/*"
Now, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
cd
guide-neon-next-authjs
npm
install
next-auth@beta
npm
install
@auth/pg-adapter
@neondatabase/serverless
For authentication, we'll use the
Auth.js
library (aliased as v5 of the
next-auth
package), which provides a simple way to add authentication to Next.js applications. It comes with built-in support for Resend as an authentication provider. We use the
@neondatabase/serverless
package as the Postgres client for the
Auth.js
database adapter.
Also, add a
.env
file to the root of your project, which we'll use to store the Neon connection string and the Resend API key:
touch
.env
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon console and go to the
Projects
section.
Click the
New Project
button to create a new project.
Choose your preferred region and Postgres version, then click
Create Project
.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Add this connection string to your
.env
file:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
"YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING"
Configuring Auth.js and Resend
Set up Resend
Sign up for a
Resend
account if you don't already have one.
In the Resend dashboard, create an API key.
Add the API key to your
.env
file:
# .env
AUTH_RESEND_KEY
=
"YOUR_RESEND_API_KEY"
Optional: Resend requires verification of ownership for the domain you use to send emails from. If you own a domain, you can follow the instructions
here
to verify ownership.
For this example, we'll use the test email address (
onboarding@resend.dev
) to send emails. However, this only works for the email address you use to sign up for a Resend account, so you won't be able to sign in from other email accounts.
Configure Auth.js
Create a new file
auth.ts
in the root directory of the project and add the following content:
/// auth.ts
import
NextAuth
from
'next-auth'
;
import
Resend
from
'next-auth/providers/resend'
;
import
PostgresAdapter
from
'@auth/pg-adapter'
;
import
{ Pool }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
// *DO NOT* create a `Pool` here, outside the request handler.
export
const
{
handlers
,
auth
,
signIn
,
signOut
}
=
NextAuth
(()
=>
{
const
pool
=
new
Pool
({ connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
});
return
{
adapter
:
PostgresAdapter
(pool)
,
providers
:
[
Resend
({ from
:
'Test <onboarding@resend.dev>'
})]
,
};
});
This file sets up Auth.js with the Neon Postgres adapter and configures the Email provider for magic link authentication.
Additionally,
Auth.js
also requires setting up an
AUTH_SECRET
environment variable, which is used to encrypt cookies and magic tokens. You can use the
Auth.js
CLI to generate one:
npx
auth
secret
Add the generated secret to your
.env
file:
# .env
AUTH_SECRET
=
"YOUR_AUTH_SECRET"
Implement authentication routes
Create a new dynamic route at
app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
with the following content:
/// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import
{ handlers }
from
'@/auth'
;
export
const
{
GET
,
POST
}
=
handlers;
This route file imports the authentication handlers from the
auth.ts
file that handle all auth-related requests — sign-in, sign-out, and redirect after authentication.
The
auth
object exported from
./auth.ts
is the universal method we can use to interact with the authentication state in the application. For example, we add a message above the main app layout that indicates the current user's name and a sign-out button at the bottom.
Implementing the application
Create the database schema
Create a new file
app/db/schema.sql
with the following content:

This schema defines all the tables required for the
Auth.js
library to work, and also the
todos
table that we'll use to store the todo list for each user.
To apply this schema to your Neon database, you can use the
Neon SQL Editor
in the web console or a database management tool like
psql
.

Create API routes for the todos feature
Create a new file
app/api/todos/route.ts
:
import
{ NextResponse }
from
'next/server'
;
import
{ auth }
from
'@/auth'
;
import

Request
) {
const
session
=
await
auth

if
(
!
session) {
return
NextResponse
.json
({ error

'Unauthorized'
}
,
{ status

401
});
}
const
{
content

=
await
req
.json

const
pool

try
{
const

'Failed to create todo'
}
,
{ status
:
500
});
}
finally
{
await
pool
.end
();
}
}
This implements a simple API endpoint that allows users to create new todos.
Create another file
app/api/todos/[id]/route.ts
:
import
{ NextResponse }
from
'next/server'
;
import
{ auth }
from
'../../auth/[...nextauth]/route'

404
});
}
return
NextResponse
.json
(rows[
0
]);
}
catch
(error) {
return
NextResponse
.json
({ error
:
'Failed to update todo'
}
,
{ status
:
500
});
}
finally
{
await
pool
.end
();
}
}
This implements a simple API endpoint that allows users to update the status of a todo.
Running the application
To start the application, run:
npm
run
dev
This will start the Next.js development server. Open your browser and navigate to
http://localhost:3000
to see the application in action. When running for the first time, you'll be see a
Sign In
link which will redirect you to the
Auth.js
widget, prompting you to input your email address. Enter your email to receive a magic link. Once authenticated, you'll be able to add and manage your todos.
Note that if you are using the test email address (
onboarding@resend.dev
) to send emails, you won't be able to sign in from other email accounts.
Conclusion
In this guide, we demonstrated how to set up a Next.js application with Auth.js for magic link authentication, using Neon Postgres as the database backend for both authentication and application data. We implemented a simple todo list feature to showcase how authenticated users can interact with the application.
Next, we can add more routes and features to the application. The
auth
method can be used in the Next.js API routes or middleware to protect endpoints that require authentication.
To view and manage the users who authenticated with your application, you can query the
users
table of your Neon project. Similarly, all the generated magic link tokens are logged in the
verification_token
table, making it easy to audit and revoke access to your application.
Source code
You can find the source code for the application described in this guide on GitHub.

Authenticate Neon Postgres application users with Clerk
Learn how to add authentication to a Neon Postgres database application using Clerk
User authentication is a critical requirement for web applications. Modern applications require advanced features like social login and multi-factor authentication besides the regular login flow. Additionally, managing personally identifiable information (PII) requires a secure solution compliant with data protection regulations.
Coming soon
Looking to manage
authorization
along with authentication? Currently in Early Access for select users,
Neon RLS
brings JSON Web Token (JWT) authorization directly to Postgres, where you can use Row-level Security (RLS) policies to manage access at the database level.
Clerk
is a user authentication and identity management platform that provides these features out of the box. It comes with adapters for popular web frameworks, making it easy to integrate with an application backed by a Neon Postgres database.
In this guide, we'll walk through setting up a simple Next.js application using Neon Postgres as the database, and add user authentication using
Clerk
. We will go over how to:
Set up a Next.js project with Clerk for authentication
Create a Neon Postgres database and connect it to your application
Define a database schema using Drizzle ORM and generate migrations
Store and retrieve user data associated with Clerk user IDs
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A
Clerk
account for user authentication. Clerk provides a free plan that you can use to get started.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Initialize your Next.js project
We will create a simple web app that lets you add a favorite quote to the home page, and edit it afterward. Run the following command in your terminal to create a new
Next.js
project:
npx
create-next-app
guide-neon-next-clerk
--typescript
--eslint
--tailwind
--use-npm
--no-src-dir
--app
--import-alias
"@/*"
Now, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
drizzle-orm
npm
install
-D
drizzle-kit
dotenv
npm
install
@clerk/nextjs
We use the
@neondatabase/serverless
package as the Postgres client, and
drizzle-orm
, a lightweight typescript ORM, to interact with the database.
@clerk/nextjs
is the Clerk SDK for Next.js applications. We also use
dotenv
to manage environment variables and the
drizzle-kit
CLI tool for generating database migrations.
Also, add a
.env
file to the root of your project, which we'll use to store Neon/Clerk connection parameters:
touch
.env
Make sure to add an entry for
.env
to your
.gitignore
file, so that it's not committed to your repository.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select an existing project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Choose the desired region and Postgres version for your project, then click
Create Project
.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Add this connection string to the
.env
file in your Next.js project.
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
Configuring Clerk for authentication
Create a Clerk application
Log in to the
Clerk Dashboard
. Select
Create Application
to create a new app.
In the dialog that appears, provide a name for your application and a few sign-in options. For this tutorial, we'll use
Email
,
Google
and
GitHub
as allowed sign-in methods.
Retrieve your API keys
From the
Configure
tab, click on
API Keys
to find your API keys, needed to authenticate your application with Clerk. Select the
Next.js
option to get them as environment variables for your Next.js project. It should look similar to this:
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
=
**************
CLERK_SECRET_KEY
=
**************
Add these variables to the
.env
file in your Next.js project.
Implementing the application
Define your database connection and schema
Create a
db
folder inside the
app/
directory. This is where we'll define the database schema and connection code.
Now, add the file
app/db/index.ts
with the following content:
/// app/db/index.ts
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ UserMessages }
from
'./schema'
;
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
) {
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL must be a Neon postgres connection string'
);
}
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
export
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql
,
{
schema
:
{ UserMessages }
,
});
This exports a
db
instance that we can use to execute queries against the Neon database.
Next, create a
schema.ts
file inside the
app/db
directory to define the database schema:
/// app/db/schema.ts
import
{ pgTable
,
text
,
timestamp }
from
'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
;
export
const
UserMessages
=
pgTable
(
'user_messages'
,
{
user_id
:
text
(
'user_id'
)
.primaryKey
()
.notNull
()
,
createTs
:
timestamp
(
'create_ts'
)
.defaultNow
()
.notNull
()
,
message
:
text
(
'message'
)
.notNull
()
,
});
This schema defines a table
user_messages
to store a message for each user, with the
user_id
provided by Clerk as the primary key.
Generate and run migrations
We'll use the
drizzle-kit
CLI tool to generate migrations for the schema we defined. To configure how it connects to the database, add a
drizzle.config.ts
file at the project root.
/// drizzle.config.ts
import
type
{ Config }
from
'drizzle-kit'
;
import
'dotenv/config'
;
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
)
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL not found in environment'
);
export
default
{
schema
:
'./app/db/schema.ts'
,
out
:
'./drizzle'
,
driver
:
'pg'
,
dbCredentials
:
{
connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
}
,
strict
:
true
,
}
satisfies
Config
;
Now, generate the migration files by running the following command:
npx
drizzle-kit
generate:pg
This will create a
drizzle
folder at the project root with the migration files. To apply the migration to the database, run:
npx
drizzle-kit
push:pg
The
user_messages
table will now be visible in the Neon console.
Add authentication middleware
The
Clerk
sdk handles user authentication and session management for us. Create a new file
middleware.ts
in the root directory so
all the app routes are protected by Clerk's authentication:
/// middleware.ts
import
{ clerkMiddleware }
from
'@clerk/nextjs/server'
;
export
default
clerkMiddleware
();
export
const
config
=
{
matcher
:
[
// Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
'/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)'
,
// Always run for API routes
'/(api|trpc)(.*)'
,
]
,
};
Next, we wrap the full application with the
ClerkProvider
component, so all pages have access to the current session and user context. Replace the contents of the
app/layout.tsx
file with the following:
import
type
{ Metadata }
from
'next'
;
import
{ Inter }
from
'next/font/google'
;
import
'./globals.css'
;
import
{ ClerkProvider
,
UserButton }
from
'@clerk/nextjs'
;
const
inter
=
Inter
({ subsets
:
[
'latin'
] });
export
const
metadata
:
Metadata
=
{
title
:
'Neon-Next-Clerk guide'
,
description
:
'Generated by create next app'
,
};
export
default
function
RootLayout
({
children
,
}
:
Readonly
<{
children
:
React
.
ReactNode
;
}>) {
return
(
<
ClerkProvider
>
<
html
lang
=
"en"
>
<
body
className
=
{
inter
.className}>
<
div
className
=
"bg-white p-4"
>
<
UserButton
showName
=
{
true
}></
UserButton
>
</
div
>
{children}
</
body
>
</
html
>
</
ClerkProvider
>
);
}
This also adds a
UserButton
component to the layout, which displays the user's name and avatar when logged in.
Add interactivity to the application
Our application has a single page that lets the logged-in user store their favorite quote and displays it. We implement
Next.js
server action to handle the form submission and database interaction.
Create a new file at
app/actions.ts
with the following content:
'use server'
;
import
{ currentUser }
from
'@clerk/nextjs/server'
;
import
{ UserMessages }
from
'./db/schema'
;
import
{ db }
from
'./db'
;
import
{ redirect }
from
'next/navigation'
;
import
{ eq }
from
'drizzle-orm'
;
export
async
function
createUserMessage
(formData
:
FormData
) {
const
user
=
await
currentUser
();
if
(
!
user)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not found'
);
const
message
=
formData
.get
(
'message'
)
as
string
;
await
db
.insert
(UserMessages)
.values
({
user_id
:
user
.id
,
message
,
});
redirect
(
'/'
);
}
export
async
function
deleteUserMessage
() {
const
user
=
await
currentUser
();
if
(
!
user)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not found'
);
await
db
.delete
(UserMessages)
.where
(
eq
(
UserMessages
.user_id
,
user
.id));
redirect
(
'/'
);
}
The
createUserMessage
function inserts a new message into the
user_messages
table, while
deleteUserMessage
removes the message associated with the current user.
Next, we implement a minimal UI to interact with these functions. Replace the contents of the
app/page.tsx
file with the following:
import
{ createUserMessage
,
deleteUserMessage }
from
'./actions'
;
import
{ db }
from
'./db'
;
import
{ currentUser }
from
'@clerk/nextjs/server'
;
async
function
getUserMessage
() {
const
user
=
await
currentUser
();
if
(
!
user)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not found'
);
return
db
.
query
.
UserMessages
.findFirst
({
where
:
(messages
,
{ eq })
=>
eq
(
messages
.user_id
,
user
.id)
,
});
}
export
default
async
function
Home
() {
const
existingMessage
=
await
getUserMessage
();
const
ui
=
existingMessage
?
(
<

This implements a form with a single text field that lets the user input a quote, and submit it, whereby it gets stored in the database, associated with their
Clerk
user ID. If a quote is already stored, it displays it and provides a button to delete it.
The
currentuser
hook from
@clerk/nextjs/server
provides the current user's information, which we use to interact with the database on their behalf.
Running the application
To start the application, run the following command:
npm
run
dev
This will start the Next.js development server. Open your browser and navigate to
http://localhost:3000
to see the application in action. When running for the first time, you'll be prompted to sign in with Clerk. Once authenticated, you'll be able to visit the home page, add a quote, and see it displayed.
Conclusion
In this guide, we walked through setting up a simple Next.js application with user authentication using Clerk and a Neon Postgres database. We defined a database schema using Drizzle ORM, generated migrations, and interacted with the database to store and retrieve user data.
Next, we can add more routes and features to the application. The Clerk middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access any app routes, and the
ClerkProvider
component provides the user context to each of them.
To view and manage the users who authenticated with your application, you can navigate to the
Clerk Dashboard
.

Authenticate Neon Postgres application users with Okta
Learn how to add authentication to a Neon Postgres database application with Okta
User authentication is critical for web applications, especially for apps internal to an organization.
Okta Workforce Indentity Cloud
is an identity and access management platform for organizations, that provides authentication, authorization, and user management capabilities.
In this guide, we'll walk through building a simple Next.js application using
Neon's
Postgres database, and add user authentication to it using
Okta
. We will cover how to:
Set up a Next.js project with Okta for authentication
Create a Neon Postgres database and connect it to your application
Define a database schema using Drizzle ORM and generate migrations
Store and retrieve user data associated with Okta user IDs
note
Okta provides a different solution called
Customer Identity Cloud
, powered by
Auth0
, to authenticate external customers for Saas applications. This guide focuses on the
Workforce Identity Cloud
for internal applications. For an example guide using
Auth0
, refer to our
Auth0
guide.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
An
Okta
administrator account for user authentication. Okta provides a free trial that you can use to set one up for your organization.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Initialize your Next.js project
We will create a simple web app that lets you add a favorite quote to the home page, and edit it afterwards. Run the following command in your terminal to create a new
Next.js
project:
npx
create-next-app
guide-neon-next-okta
--typescript
--eslint
--tailwind
--use-npm
--no-src-dir
--app
--import-alias
"@/*"
Now, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
drizzle-orm
npm
install
-D
drizzle-kit
dotenv
npm
install
next-auth@beta
We use the
@neondatabase/serverless
package as the Postgres client, and
drizzle-orm
, a lightweight typescript ORM, to interact with the database. We also use
dotenv
to manage environment variables and the
drizzle-kit
CLI tool for generating database migrations. For authentication, we'll use the
auth.js
library (aliased as v5 of the
next-auth
package), which provides a simple way to add authentication to Next.js applications. It comes with built-in support for Okta.
Also, add a
.env.local
file to the root of your project, which we'll use to store Neon/Okta connection parameters:
touch
.env.local
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select an existing project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Choose the desired region and Postgres version for your project, then click
Create Project
.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Add this connection string to the
.env.local
file in your Next.js project.
# .env.local
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
Configuring Okta for authentication
Create an Okta application
Log in to your Okta developer account and navigate to the
Applications
section. Click the
Create App Integration
button.
Select
OIDC - OpenID Connect
as the sign-in method.
Select
Web Application
as the application type and click
Next
.
Provide a name for your application, e.g., "Neon Next Guide".
Set
Sign-in redirect URIs
to
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/okta
and
Sign-out redirect URIs
to
http://localhost:3000
.
Click
Save
to create the application.
Retrieve your Okta configuration
From the application's
General
tab, find the
Client ID
and
Client SECRET
. Also note your Okta
Issuer URI
, which is the first part of your Okta account's URL, e.g.,
https://dev-12345.okta.com
. If it isn't clear, visit the
Security > API
section from the sidebar in the console to find the
Issuer URI
and remove
/oauth2/default
from the end.
Add these as environment variables to the
.env.local
file in your Next.js project:
# .env.local
AUTH_OKTA_ISSUER
=
YOUR_OKTA_ISSUER
AUTH_OKTA_ID
=
YOUR_CLIENT_ID
AUTH_OKTA_SECRET
=
YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
AUTH_SECRET
=
YOUR_SECRET
The last variable,
AUTH_SECRET
, is a random string used by
Auth.js
to encrypt tokens. Run the following command to generate one and add it to your
.env.local
file:
npx
auth
secret
note
If you set up an Okta organization account specifically for this guide, you might need to assign yourself to the created Okta application to test the authentication flow. Visit
Applications > Applications
from the sidebar and select the application you created. In the
Assignments
tab, click
Assign
and select your own user account.
Implementing the application
Define database connection and schema
Create a
db
folder inside the
app/
directory. This is where we'll define the database schema and connection code.
Now, add the file
app/db/index.ts
with the following content:
/// app/db/index.ts
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ UserMessages }
from
'./schema'
;
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
) {
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL must be a Neon postgres connection string'
);
}
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
export
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql
,
{
schema
:
{ UserMessages }
,
});
This exports a
db
instance that we can use to execute queries against the Neon database.
Next, create a
schema.ts
file inside the
app/db
directory to define the database schema:
/// app/db/schema.ts
import
{ pgTable
,
text
,
timestamp }
from
'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
;
export
const
UserMessages
=
pgTable
(
'user_messages'
,
{
user_id
:
text
(
'user_id'
)
.primaryKey
()
.notNull
()
,
createTs
:
timestamp
(
'create_ts'
)
.defaultNow
()
.notNull
()
,
message
:
text
(
'message'
)
.notNull
()
,
});
This schema defines a table
user_messages
to store a message for each user, with the
user_id
provided by Auth0 as the primary key.
Generate and run migrations
We'll use the
drizzle-kit
CLI tool to generate migrations for the schema we defined. To configure how it connects to the database, add a
drizzle.config.ts
file at the project root.
/// drizzle.config.ts
import
type
{ Config }
from
'drizzle-kit'
;
import
*
as
dotenv
from
'dotenv'
;
dotenv
.config
({ path
:
'.env.local'
});
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
)
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL not found in environment'
);
export
default
{
schema
:
'./app/db/schema.ts'
,
out
:
'./drizzle'
,
driver
:
'pg'
,
dbCredentials
:
{
connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
}
,
strict
:
true
,
}
satisfies
Config
;
Now, generate the migration files by running the following command:
npx
drizzle-kit
generate:pg
This will create a
drizzle
folder at the project root with the migration files. To apply the migration to the database, run:
npx
drizzle-kit
push:pg
The
user_messages
table will now be visible in the Neon console.
Configure Okta authentication
Create a new file
auth.ts
in the root directory of the project and add the following content:
import
NextAuth
from
'next-auth'
;
import
Okta
from
'next-auth/providers/okta'
;
export
const
{
handlers
,
signIn
,
signOut
,
auth
}
=
NextAuth
({
providers
:
[Okta]
,
callbacks
:
{
async
session
({ session
,
token }) {
session
.
user
.id
=
token
.sub
as
string
;
return
session;
}
,
}
,
});
This file initializes
Auth.js
with Okta as the authentication provider. It also defines a callback to set the
sub
claim from the Okta token as the session user ID.
Implement authentication routes
Create a new dynamic route at
app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
with the following content:
/// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import
{ handlers }
from
'@/auth'
;
export
const
{
GET
,
POST
}
=
handlers;
This route file imports the authentication handlers from the
auth.ts
file that handle all auth-related requests — sign-in, sign-out, and redirect after authentication.
The
auth
object exported from
./auth.ts
is the universal method we can use to interact with the authentication state in the application. For example, we add a
User information
bar to the app layout that indicates the current user's name and provides a sign-out button.
Replace the contents of the
app/layout.tsx
file with the following:
import
type
{ Metadata }
from
'next'
;
import
{ Inter }
from
'next/font/google'
;
import
'./globals.css'
;
import
{ auth }
from
'@/auth'
;
const
inter
=
Inter
({ subsets
:
[
'latin'
] });
export
const
metadata
:
Metadata
=
{
title
:
'Create Next App'
,
description
:
'Generated by create next app'
,
};
async
function
UserInfoBar
() {
const
session
=
await
auth
();
if
(
!
session) {
return
null
;
}
return
(
<
div
className
=
"bg-gray-100 px-4 py-2"
>
<
span
className
=
"text-gray-800"
>
Welcome, {
session
.
user
?.name}!{
' '
}
<
a
href
=
"/api/auth/signout"
className
=
"text-blue-600 hover:underline"
>
Sign out
</
a
>
</
span
>
</
div
>
);
}
export
default
function
RootLayout
({
children
,
}
:
Readonly
<{
children
:
React
.
ReactNode
;
}>) {
return
(
<
html
lang
=
"en"
>
<
body
className
=
{
inter
.className}>
<
UserInfoBar
/>
{children}
</
body
>
</
html
>
);
}
Add interactivity to the application
Our application has a single page that lets the logged-in user store their favorite quote and display it. We implement
Next.js
server actions to handle the form submission and database interaction.
Create a new file at
app/actions.ts
with the following content:
/// app/actions.ts
'use server'
;
import
{ auth }
from
'@/auth'
;
import
{ UserMessages }
from
'./db/schema'
;
import
{ db }
from
'./db'
;
import
{ redirect }
from
'next/navigation'
;
import
{ eq }
from
'drizzle-orm'
;
export
async
function
createUserMessage
(formData
:
FormData
) {
const
session
=
await
auth
();
if
(
!
session)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not authenticated'
);
const
message
=
formData
.get
(
'message'
)
as
string
;
await
db
.insert
(UserMessages)
.values
({
user_id
:
session
.
user
?.id
as
string
,
message
,
});
redirect
(
'/'
);
}
export
async
function
deleteUserMessage
() {
const
session
=
await
auth
();
if
(
!
session)
throw
new
Error
(
'User not authenticated'
);
await
db
.delete
(UserMessages)
.where
(
eq
(
UserMessages
.user_id
,
session
.
user
?.id
as
string
));
redirect
(
'/'
);
}
The
createUserMessage
function inserts a new message into the
user_messages
table, while
deleteUserMessage
removes the message associated with the current user.
Next, we implement a minimal UI to interact with these functions. Replace the contents of the
app/page.tsx
file with the following:
/// app/page.tsx
import
{ createUserMessage
,
deleteUserMessage }
from
'./actions'
;
import
{ db }
from
'./db'
;
import
{ auth }
from
'@/auth'
;
async
function
getUserMessage
() {
const
session
=
await
auth
();
if
(
!
session)
return
null
;
return
db
.
query
.
UserMessages
.findFirst
({
where
:
(messages
,
{ eq })
=>
eq
(
messages
.user_id
,
session
.
user
?.id
as
string
)
,
});
}
function

}
This code implements a form with a single text field that lets the user input a quote, and submit it, whereby the quote is stored in the database and associated with the user's
Okta
user ID. If a quote is already stored, it displays the quote and provides a button to delete it.
The
user.id
property set on the session object provides the current user's ID, which we use to interact with the database on their behalf. If the user is not authenticated, the page displays a login button instead.
Running the application
To start the application, run the following command:
npm
run
dev
This will start the Next.js development server. Open your browser and navigate to
http://localhost:3000
to see the application in action. When running for the first time, you'll see a
Log In
button which will redirect you to the
Auth.js
widget, prompting you to sign in with Okta.
Once authenticated, you'll be able to visit the home page, add a quote, and see it displayed.
Conclusion
In this guide, we walked through setting up a simple Next.js application with user authentication using Okta and a Neon Postgres database. We defined a database schema using Drizzle ORM, generated migrations, and interacted with the database to store and retrieve user data.
Next, we can add more routes and features to the application. The
auth
method can be used in the Next.js API routes or middleware to protect endpoints that require authentication.
To view and manage the users who authenticated with your application, you can navigate to your Okta admin console and view the
Directory > People
section in the sidebar.

Understanding Neon’s autoscaling algorithm
How Neon’s algorithm scales resources to match your workload
What you will learn:
Key metrics that drive autoscaling decisions
How often the algorithm checks these metrics
Related topics
Introduction to autoscaling
Enabling autoscaling
The key concept behind autoscaling is that compute resizing happens
automatically
— once you set up your minimum and maximum
compute sizes
, there’s no action required on your part other than
monitoring
your usage metrics to see if adjustments are needed.
That said, it can be helpful to understand exactly when and under what circumstances the algorithm optimizes your database on two key fronts —
performance
and
efficiency
. In a nutshell, the algorithm automatically
scales up
your compute to ensure optimal performance and
scales down
to maximize efficiency.
How the algorithm works
Neon's autoscaling algorithm uses two components, the
vm-monitor
and the
autoscaler-agent
, to continuously monitor three key metrics: your average CPU load, your memory usage, and the activity of your
Local File Cache (LFC)
. These metrics determine how your compute resources — the virtual machine that powers your database — should be scaled to maintain performance and efficiency.
The Formula
In essence, the algorithm is built on
goals
. We set a goal (an ideal compute size) for each of the three key metrics:
cpuGoalCU
— Keep the 1-minute average CPU load at or below 90% of the available CPU capacity.
memGoalCU
— Keep memory usage at or below 75% of the total allocated RAM.
lfcGoalCU
— Fit your frequently accessed working set within 75% of the compute's RAM allocated to the LFC.
The formula can be expressed as:
goalCU
:=
max
(
cpuGoalCU,
memGoalCU,
lfcGoalCU
)
The algorithm selects the highest value from these goals as the overall
goalCU
, ensuring your database has enough resources to handle the most demanding metric — while staying within the minimum and maximum limits you’ve set.
The Metrics
Let's go into a bit more detail about each metric.
CPU load average
The CPU load average is a measure of how much work your CPU is handling. Every 5 seconds, the autoscaler-agent checks the 1-minute load average from the virtual machine (VM) running your database. This load average reflects the average number of processes waiting to be executed by the vCPU over the previous minute.
The goal is to keep the CPU load at or below 90% of the available vCPU capacity. If the load exceeds this threshold, the algorithm increases the compute allocated to your database to handle the additional demand.
In simpler terms, if your database is working too hard, the algorithm adds more CPU power to keep things running smoothly.
Memory Usage
Memory usage refers to the amount of RAM your database and its related processes are using. Every 5 seconds, the autoscaler-agent checks for the latest memory metrics from inside the VM, and every 100ms the vm-monitor checks memory usage from Postgres.
The algorithm aims to keep overall memory usage at or below 75% of the total allocated memory. If your database starts using more memory than this threshold, the algorithm increases compute size to allocate more memory, making sure your database has enough RAM to perform well without over-provisioning.
Local File Cache (LFC) working set size
An important part of the scaling algorithm is estimating your current working set size — a subset of your most frequently accessed data — and scaling your compute to ensure it fits within the LFC.
Every 20 seconds, the autoscaler-agent checks the working set size across a variety of time windows, ranging from 1 to 60 minutes. The goal is to fit your working set within 75% of the compute’s RAM allocated to the LFC. If your working set exceeds this threshold, the algorithm increases compute size to expand the LFC, keeping frequently accessed data in memory for faster access. To learn more about how we do this, see
Dynamically estimating and scaling Postgres’ working set size
.
note
If your dataset is small enough, you can improve performance by keeping the entire dataset in memory. Check your database size on the Monitoring
dashboard
and adjust your minimum compute size accordingly. For example, a 6.4 GB database can comfortably fit within a compute size of 2 vCPU with 8 GB of RAM (where the LFC can use up to 75% of the available RAM).
How often the metrics are polled
To give you a sense of the algorithm's responsiveness, here's a summary of how often the metrics are polled:
Every 5 seconds
→ the autoscaler-agent fetches load metrics from the VM, including CPU usage and overall memory usage.
Every 20 seconds
→ the autoscaler-agent checks the Local File Cache (LFC) metrics, including the working set size across various time windows: 1 minute, 2 minutes, up to 60 minutes.
Every 100 milliseconds
→ the vm-monitor checks memory usage specifically within Postgres.
This frequent polling allows the algorithm to respond swiftly to changes in workload, ensuring that your compute resources are always appropriately scaled to meet current demands.

About autoscaling
How the algorithm works
This guide demonstrates how to enable autoscaling in your Neon project and how to
visualize
your usage.
Did you know?
Neon's autoscaling feature instantly scales your compute and memory resources.
No manual intervention or restarts are required.
Enable autoscaling for a compute
You can edit an individual compute to alter the compute configuration, which includes autoscaling.
To edit a compute:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
On the
Computes
tab, identify the compute you want to configure and click
Edit
.
On the
Edit compute
drawer, select
Autoscale
and use the slider to specify a minimum and maximum compute size.
Neon scales the compute size up and down within the specified range to meet workload demand. Autoscaling currently supports a range of 1/4 (.25) to 16 vCPUs. One vCPU has 4 GB of RAM, 2 vCPUs have 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the number of vCPUs. For an overview of available compute sizes, see
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
. Please note that when the autoscaling maximum is > 10, the autoscaling minimum must be ≥ (max / 8).
note
You can configure the scale to zero setting for your compute at the same time. For more, see
Scale to Zero
.
Click
Save
.
Configure autoscaling defaults for your project
You can configure autoscaling configuration defaults for your project so that
newly created computes
(including those created when you create a new branch or add read replica) are created with the same autoscaling configuration. This saves you from having to configure autoscaling settings with each new compute. See
Change your project's default compute settings
for more detail.
note
Changing your autoscaling default settings does not alter the autoscaling configuration for existing computes.
To configure autoscaling defaults:
Navigate to your Project Dashboard and select
Settings
from the sidebar.
Select
Compute
.
Select
Change
to open the
Change default compute settings
modal.
Use the slider to specify a minimum and maximum compute size and
Save
your changes.
The next time you create a compute, these settings will be applied to it.
Autoscaling defaults for each Neon plan
The following table outlines the initial default autoscaling settings for newly created projects on each Neon plan.

Monitor autoscaling
From the Neon Console, you can view how your vCPU and RAM usage have scaled for the past 24 hours. On the
Project Dashboard
page, navigate down the page to the
Monitoring
section.
Some key points about this Autoscaling graph:
Allocated
refers to the vCPU and memory size provisioned to handle current demand; autoscaling automatically adjusts this allocation, increasing or decreasing the allocated vCPU and memory size in a step-wise fashion as demand fluctuates, within your minimum and maximum limits.
VCPU Usage
is represented by the green line
RAM usage
is represented by the blue line.
A re-activated compute scales up immediately to your minimum allocation, ensuring adequate performance for your anticipated demand.
Place your cursor anywhere in the graph to get more usage detail about that particular point in time.
See below for some rules of thumb on actions you might want to take based on trends you see in this view.
Start with a good minimum
Ideally, for smaller datasets, you want to keep as much of your dataset in memory (RAM) as possible. This improves performance by minimizing I/O operations. We recommend setting a large enough minimum limit to fit your full dataset in memory. For larger datasets and more sizing advice, see
how to size your compute
.
Setting your maximum
If your autoscaling graphs show regular spikes that hit your maximum setting, consider increasing your maximum. However, because these spikes plateau at the maximum setting, it can be difficult to determine your actual demand.
Another approach is to set a higher threshold than you need and monitor usage spikes to get a sense of where your typical maximum demand reaches; you can then throttle the maximum setting down closer to anticipated/historical demand. Either way, with autoscaling you only use what's necessary; a higher setting does not translate to increased usage unless there's demand for it.
The neon_utils extension
Another tool for understanding usage, the
neon_utils
extension provides a
num_cpus()
function that helps you monitor how the
Autoscaling
feature allocates compute resources in response to workload. For more information, see
The neon_utils extension

};
The code in the
users.js
file exports the
getAllUsers
function, which retrieves all rows from the
users
table and returns them as a
JSON
object in the
HTTP
response body.
This function uses the
pg
library to connect to the Neon database. It creates a new
Client
instance and passes the database connection string, which is defined in the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable. It then calls
connect()
to establish a connection to the database. Finally, it uses the
query()
method to execute a
SELECT
statement that retrieves all rows from the
users
table.
The query method returns a
Promise
that resolves to an object containing the rows retrieved by the
SELECT
statement, which the function parses to retrieve the
rows
property. Finally, the function returns an
HTTP
response with a status code of 200 and a body that contains a
JSON
object with a single
data
property, which is set to the value of the rows variable.
Add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable and the function definition to the
serverless.yml
file, which is located in your
aws-node-project
directory.
note
Environment variables can also be added to a
.env
file and loaded automatically with the help of the
dotenv
package. For more information, see
Resolution of environment variables
.
You can find your database connection details by clicking the

Enabling CORS
If you make API calls to the Lambda function from your app, you will likely need to configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Visit the AWS documentation for information about
how to enable CORS in API Gateway
.
You can run the following command to enable CORS to your local development environment:
aws
apigatewayv2
update-api
--api-id
<
api-i
d
>
--cors-configuration
AllowOrigins=
"http://localhost:3000"
You can find your
api-id
on the API Gateway dashboard:
Conclusion
In this guide, you have learned how to set up a Postgres database using Neon and connect to it from an AWS Lambda function using Node.js as the runtime environment. You have also learned how to use Serverless Framework to create and deploy the Lambda function, and how to use the

File storage with AWS S3
Store files via AWS S3 and track metadata in Neon
Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3)
is an object storage service widely used for storing and retrieving large amounts of data, such as images, videos, backups, and application assets.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate AWS S3 with Neon by storing file metadata (like the object key and URL) in your Neon database, while using S3 for file storage.
Setup steps
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create an AWS account and S3 bucket
Sign up for or log in to your
AWS Account
.
Navigate to the
S3
service in the AWS Management Console.
Click
Create bucket
. Provide a unique bucket name (e.g.,
my-neon-app-s3-uploads
), select an AWS Region (e.g.,
us-east-1
), and configure initial settings.
Public Access (for this example):
For simplicity in accessing uploaded files via URL in this guide, we'll configure the bucket to allow public read access
for objects uploaded with specific permissions
. Under
Block Public Access settings for this bucket
,
uncheck
"Block all public access". Acknowledge the warning.
Public buckets
Making buckets or objects publicly readable carries security risks. For production applications, it's strongly recommended to:
Keep buckets
private
(Block all public access enabled).
Use
presigned URLs
not only for uploads but also for
downloads
(temporary read access).
This guide uses public access for simplicity, but you should implement secure access controls in production.
After the bucket is created, navigate to the
Permissions
tab. Under
Bucket Policy
, you can set up a policy to allow public read access to objects. For example:
{
"Version"
:
"2012-10-17"
,
"Statement"
:
[
{
"Sid"
:
"PublicReadGetObject"
,
"Effect"
:
"Allow"
,
"Principal"
:
"*"
,
"Action"
:
"s3:GetObject"
,
"Resource"
:
"arn:aws:s3:::my-neon-app-s3-uploads/*"
}
]
}
Replace
my-neon-app-s3-uploads
with your actual bucket name.
Create IAM user for programmatic access:
Navigate to the
IAM
service in the AWS Console.
Go to
Users
and click
Add users
.
Enter a username (e.g.,
neon-app-s3-user
). Select
Access key - Programmatic access
as the credential type. Click
Next: Permissions
.
Choose
Attach policies directly
. Search for and select
AmazonS3FullAccess
.
Click
Next
, then
Create user
.
Click on
Create access key
.
Click
Other
>
Create access key
. Copy the
Access key ID
and
Secret access key
. These will be used in your application to authenticate with AWS S3.
Configure CORS for client-side uploads
If your application involves uploading files
directly from a web browser
using the generated presigned URLs, you must configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your S3 bucket. CORS rules tell S3 which web domains are allowed to make requests (like
PUT
requests for uploads) to your bucket. Without proper CORS rules, browser security restrictions will block these direct uploads.
In your S3 bucket settings, navigate to the
Permissions
tab and find the
CORS configuration
section. Add the following CORS rules:
[
{
"AllowedHeaders"
:
[
"*"
]
,
"AllowedMethods"
:
[
"GET"
,
"PUT"
]
,
"AllowedOrigins"
:
[
"*"
]
,
"ExposeHeaders"
:
[]
,
"MaxAgeSeconds"
:
9000
}
]
This configuration allows any origin (
*
) to perform
GET
and
PUT
requests. In a production environment, you should restrict
AllowedOrigins
to your application's domain(s) for security.
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need a table in Neon to store metadata about the objects uploaded to S3.
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a client like
psql
. Create a table including the object key, URL, user ID, and timestamp:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
s3_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
object_key
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
-- Key (path/filename) in S3
file_url
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- Publicly accessible URL (if object is public)
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Run the SQL statement. Add other relevant columns as needed (e.g.,
content_type
,
size
).
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, remember to apply appropriate access policies to the
s3_files
table. This controls who can view or modify the object references stored in Neon based on your RLS rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata in Neon. Access control for the objects within the S3 bucket itself is managed via S3 bucket policies, IAM permissions, and object ACLs.
Upload files to S3 and store metadata in Neon
The recommended pattern for client-side uploads to S3 involves
presigned upload URLs
. Your backend generates a temporary URL that the client uses to upload the file directly to S3. Afterwards, your backend saves the file's metadata to Neon.
This requires two backend endpoints:
/presign-upload
: Generates the temporary presigned URL.
/save-metadata
: Records the metadata in Neon after the client confirms successful upload.
JavaScript
Python
We'll use
Hono
for the server,
@aws-sdk/client-s3
and
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
for S3 interaction, and
@neondatabase/serverless
for Neon.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install

Explanation
Setup:
Initializes the Neon database client (
sql
), Hono (
app
), and the AWS S3 client (
s3
) configured with region and credentials.
Authentication:
A placeholder
authMiddleware
is included.
Crucially
, this needs to be replaced with real authentication logic. It currently just sets a static
userId
for demonstration.
Upload endpoints:
/presign-upload
:
Generates a temporary secure URL (
presignedUrl
) using
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
that allows uploading a file directly to S3. It returns the URL, the generated
objectKey
, and the standard S3 public URL.
/save-metadata
:
Called by the client
after
successful upload. Saves the
objectKey
,
file_url
, and
userId
into the
s3_files
table in Neon using
@neondatabase/serverless
.
Testing the upload workflow
Testing the presigned URL flow involves multiple steps:
Get presigned URL:
Send a
POST
request to your
/presign-upload
endpoint with a JSON body containing
fileName
and
contentType
.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/presign-upload
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"fileName": "test-s3.txt", "contentType": "text/plain"}'
You should receive a JSON response with a
presignedUrl
,
objectKey
, and
publicFileUrl
:
{
"success"
:
true
,
"presignedUrl"
:
"https://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.....&x-id=PutObject"
,
"objectKey"
:
"<OBJECT_KEY>"
,
"publicFileUrl"
:
"https://<BUCKET_NAME>.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<OBJECT_KEY>"
}
Note the
presignedUrl
,
objectKey
, and
publicFileUrl
from the response. You will use these in the next steps.
Upload file to S3:
Use the received
presignedUrl
to upload the actual file using an HTTP
PUT
request.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
PUT
"<PRESIGNED_URL>"
\
--upload-file
/path/to/your/test-s3.txt
\
-H
"Content-Type: text/plain"
A successful upload typically returns HTTP
200 OK
with no body.
Save metadata:
Send a
POST
request to your
/save-metadata
endpoint with the
objectKey
and
publicFileUrl
obtained in step 1.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/save-metadata
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"objectKey": "<OBJECT_KEY>", "publicFileUrl": "<PUBLIC_URL>"}'
You should receive a JSON response indicating success:
{
"success"
:
true
}
Expected outcome:
The file appears in your S3 bucket (check the AWS Console).
A new row appears in your
s3_files
table in Neon containing the
object_key
and
file_url
.
You can now integrate API calls to these endpoints from various parts of your application (e.g., web clients using JavaScript's
fetch
API, mobile apps, backend services) to handle file uploads.
Accessing file metadata and files
Storing metadata in Neon allows your application to easily retrieve references to the files hosted on S3.
Query the
s3_files
table from your application's backend when needed.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve files for user 'user_123':
SELECT
id,
object_key,
-- Key (path/filename) in S3
file_url,
-- Publicly accessible S3 URL
user_id,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
FROM
s3_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
;
-- Use actual authenticated user ID
Using the data:
The query returns metadata stored in Neon.
The
file_url
column contains the direct link to access the file via S3.
Use this
file_url
in your application (e.g.,
<img>
tags, download links)
Private buckets
For private S3 buckets, store only the
object_key
and generate presigned
read
URLs on demand using a similar backend process.
This pattern effectively separates file storage and delivery concerns (handled by S3) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon), leveraging the strengths of both services.

File storage with Azure Blob Storage
Store files via Azure Blob Storage and track metadata in Neon
Azure Blob Storage
is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. It's optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, such as text or binary data, including images, documents, streaming media, and archive data.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate Azure Blob Storage with Neon by storing file metadata (like the blob name and URL) in your Neon database, while using Azure Blob Storage for file storage.
Prerequisites
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create an Azure account, storage account, and container
Sign up for or log in to your
Azure Account
.
Navigate to
Storage accounts
in the Azure portal.
Click
+ Create
. Fill in the required details: select a Subscription, create or select a Resource group, provide a unique Storage account name (e.g.,
myneonappblobstorage
), choose a Region (e.g.,
East US
), and select performance/redundancy options (Standard/LRS is fine for this example). Click
Review + create
, then
Create
.
Once the storage account is deployed, go to the resource.
In the storage account menu, under
Data storage
, click
Containers
.
Click
+ Container
. Provide a name for your container (e.g.,
uploads
), set the
Public access level
to
Private (no anonymous access)
. This is the recommended setting for security; we will use SAS tokens for controlled access. Click
Create
.
Public access vs. SAS tokens
While you
can
set container access levels to allow public read access (
Blob
or
Container
), it's generally more secure to keep containers private and use
Shared Access Signatures (SAS)
tokens for both uploads and downloads. SAS tokens provide temporary, granular permissions. This guide focuses on using SAS tokens for uploads. For serving files, you can either generate read-only SAS tokens on demand or, if needed, set the container to public
Blob
access.
Get connection string:
In your storage account menu, under
Security + networking
, click
Access keys
.
Copy one of the
Connection strings
. This will be used by your backend application to authenticate with Azure Blob Storage. Store it securely.
Configure CORS for client-side uploads
If your application involves uploading files
directly from a web browser
using the generated SAS URLs, you must configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your Azure Storage account. CORS rules tell Azure Storage which web domains are allowed to make requests (like
PUT
requests for uploads) to your blob service endpoint. Without proper CORS rules, browser security restrictions will block these direct uploads.
Follow Azure's guide to
Configure CORS for Azure Storage
. You can configure CORS rules via the Azure portal (Storage account > Settings > Resource sharing (CORS) > Blob service tab).
Here’s an example CORS configuration allowing
PUT
uploads and
GET
requests from your deployed frontend application and your local development environment:
Allowed origins:
https://your-production-app.com
,
http://localhost:3000
(Replace with your actual domains/ports)
Allowed methods:
PUT
,
GET
Allowed headers:
*
(Or be more specific, e.g.,
Content-Type
,
x-ms-blob-type
)
Exposed headers:
*
Max age (seconds):
3600
(Example: 1 hour)
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need a table in Neon to store metadata about the blobs uploaded to Azure Storage.
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a client like
psql
. Create a table including the blob name, URL, user ID, and timestamp:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
azure_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
blob_name
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
-- Name (path/filename) in Azure Blob Storage container
file_url
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- Publicly accessible URL (base URL, SAS might be needed for access)
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Run the SQL statement. Add other relevant columns as needed (e.g.,
content_type
,
size
).
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, remember to apply appropriate access policies to the
azure_files
table. This controls who can view or modify the object references stored in Neon based on your RLS rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata in Neon. Access control for the blobs within the Azure container itself is managed via Azure RBAC, SAS tokens, and container access level settings.
Upload files to Azure Blob Storage and store metadata in Neon
The recommended pattern for client-side uploads to Azure Blob Storage involves
SAS (Shared Access Signature) URLs
. Your backend generates a temporary URL containing a SAS token that grants specific permissions (like writing a blob) for a limited time. The client uses this SAS URL to upload the file directly to Azure Blob Storage. Afterwards, your backend saves the file's metadata to Neon.
This requires two backend endpoints:
/generate-upload-sas
: Generates the temporary SAS URL for the client.
/save-metadata
: Records the metadata in Neon after the client confirms successful upload.
JavaScript
Python
We'll use
Hono
for the server,
@azure/storage-blob
for Azure interaction, and
@neondatabase/serverless
for Neon.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install
@azure/storage-blob
@neondatabase/serverless
@hono/node-server
hono
dotenv
Create a
.env
file:
# Azure Blob Storage Config
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING
=
"your_storage_account_connection_string"
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME
=
your_container_name
# e.g., uploads

Explanation
Setup:
Initializes Neon client (
sql
), Hono (
app
), and Azure
BlobServiceClient
using the connection string.
Authentication:
Placeholder
authMiddleware
needs replacing with actual user validation.
Upload endpoints:
/generate-upload-sas
:
Creates a unique
blobName
, gets a
BlockBlobClient
, and generates a SAS token using
generateBlobSASQueryParameters
with write permissions (
w
) and a short expiry. It returns the full
sasUrl
(base URL + SAS token), the
blobName
, and the base
fileUrl
.
/save-metadata
:
Called by the client
after
successful upload. Saves the
blobName
, base
fileUrl
, and
userId
into the
azure_files
table in Neon.
Testing the upload workflow
Testing the SAS URL flow involves multiple steps:
Get SAS URL:
Send a
POST
request to your
/generate-upload-sas
endpoint with a JSON body containing
fileName
and
contentType
.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/generate-upload-sas
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"fileName": "test-azure.txt", "contentType": "text/plain"}'
You should receive a JSON response with a
sasUrl
,
blobName
, and
fileUrl
:
{
"success"
:
true
,
"sasUrl"
:
"https://<ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/<CONTAINER>/<BLOB_NAME>?<SAS_TOKEN>"
,
"blobName"
:
"<BLOB_NAME>"
,
"fileUrl"
:
"https://<ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/<CONTAINER>/<BLOB_NAME>"
}
Note the
sasUrl
,
blobName
, and
fileUrl
from the response. You will use these in the next steps.
Upload file to Azure:
Use the received
sasUrl
to upload the actual file using an HTTP
PUT
request. You also need to set the
Content-Type
header to match what was specified during SAS generation and
x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob
.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
PUT
"<SAS_URL>"
\
--upload-file
/path/to/your/test-azure.txt
\
-H
"Content-Type: text/plain"
\
-H
"x-ms-blob-type: BlockBlob"
A successful upload returns HTTP
201 Created
.
Save metadata:
Send a
POST
request to your
/save-metadata
endpoint with the
blobName
and base
fileUrl
from step 1.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/save-metadata
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"blobName": "<BLOB_NAME_FROM_STEP_1>", "fileUrl": "<FILE_URL_FROM_STEP_1>"}'
You should receive a JSON response indicating success:
{
"success"
:
true
}
Expected outcome:
The file appears in your Azure Blob Storage container (check the Azure Portal).
A new row appears in your
azure_files
table in Neon.
You can now integrate API calls to these endpoints from various parts of your application (e.g., web clients using JavaScript
fetch
API, mobile apps, backend services) to handle file uploads.
Accessing file metadata and files
Storing metadata in Neon allows your application to easily retrieve references to the files hosted on Azure Blob Storage.
Query the
azure_files
table from your application's backend when needed.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve files for user 'user_123':
SELECT
id,
blob_name,
-- Name (path/filename) in Azure container
file_url,
-- Base URL of the blob
user_id,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
FROM
azure_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
;
-- Use actual authenticated user ID
Using the data:
The query returns metadata stored in Neon.
The
file_url
column contains the base URL of the blob.
Accessing the file:
If your container allows public
Blob
access, this
file_url
might be directly usable.
If your container is
private
(recommended), you need to generate a
read-only SAS token
for the specific
blob_name
on demand using your backend (similar to the upload SAS generation, but with
BlobSASPermissions.parse("r")
or
BlobSasPermissions(read=True)
) and append it to the
file_url
. This provides secure, temporary read access.
Use the resulting URL (base URL or URL with read SAS token) in your application (e.g.,
<img>
tags, download links).
For example here's how to generate a read SAS URL:
JavaScript
Python
import
{
BlobServiceClient
,
generateBlobSASQueryParameters
,
BlobSASPermissions
,
SASProtocol
,
}
from
'@azure/storage-blob'

const
blobServiceClient
=
BlobServiceClient
.fromConnectionString

env
.

);
async
function
generateReadOnlySasUrl
(blobName
,
expiryMinutes
=
15
) {
const
containerClient
=
blobServiceClient
.getContainerClient
(
AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME
);
const
blobClient
=
containerClient
.getBlobClient
(blobName);
const
sasOptions
=
{
containerName

*
1000
)
,
permissions
:
BlobSASPermissions
.parse
(
'r'
)
,
// Read ('r') permission
protocol
:
SASProtocol
.Https
,
};
const
sasToken
=
generateBlobSASQueryParameters
(
sasOptions
,
blobServiceClient
.credential
)
.toString
();
const
sasUrl
=
`
${
blobClient
.url
}
?
${
sasToken
}
`
;
return
sasUrl;
}
// Replace '<BLOB_NAME_FROM_DB>' with the actual blob name
generateReadOnlySasUrl
(
'<BLOB_NAME_FROM_DB>'
)
.then
((url)
=>
{
console
.log
(
'Read-only SAS URL:'
,
url);
})
.catch
((error)
=>
{
console
.error
(
'Error generating read SAS URL:'
,
error);
});
Private containers & read access
For private containers, always generate short-lived read SAS tokens when a user needs to access a file. Store only the
blob_name
and base
file_url
(or just
blob_name
) in Neon, and construct the full SAS URL in your backend when serving the file reference to the client.
This pattern effectively separates file storage and delivery concerns (handled by Azure Blob Storage) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon), leveraging the strengths of both services.

File storage with Backblaze B2
Store files via Backblaze B2 and track metadata in Neon
Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage
is an S3-compatible object storage service known for its affordability and ease of use. It's suitable for storing large amounts of unstructured data like backups, archives, images, videos, and application assets.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate Backblaze B2 with Neon by storing file metadata (like the file id, name and URL) in your Neon database, while using B2 for file storage.
Prerequisites
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create a Backblaze account and B2 bucket
Sign up for or log in to your
Backblaze account
.
Navigate to
B2 Cloud Storage
>
Buckets
in the left sidebar.
Click
Create a Bucket
. Provide a globally unique bucket name (e.g.,
my-neon-app-b2-files
), choose whether files should be
Private
or
Public
. For this guide, we'll use
Public
for simplicity, but
Private
is recommended for production applications where you want to control access to files.
Create application key:
Navigate to
B2 Cloud Storage
>
Application Keys
in the left sidebar.
Click
+ Add a New Application Key
.
Give the key a name (e.g.,
neon-app-b2-key
).
Crucially
, restrict the key's access: Select
Allow access to Bucket(s)
and choose the bucket you just created (e.g.,
my-neon-app-b2-files
).
Select
Read and Write
for the
Type of Access
.
Leave other fields blank unless needed (e.g., File name prefix).
Click
Create New Key
.
Copy the
Key ID
and
Application Key
. These will be used in your application to authenticate with B2.
Find S3 endpoint:
Navigate back to
B2 Cloud Storage
>
Buckets
.
Find your bucket and note the
Endpoint
URL listed (e.g.,
s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com
). You'll need this S3-compatible endpoint for the SDK configuration.
Configure CORS for client-side uploads
If your application involves uploading files
directly from a web browser
using the generated presigned URLs, you must configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules for your B2 bucket. CORS rules tell B2 which web domains are allowed to make requests (like
PUT
requests for uploads) to your bucket. Without proper CORS rules, browser security restrictions will block these direct uploads.
Follow Backblaze's guide to
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Rules
. You configure CORS rules in the B2 Bucket Settings page in the Backblaze web UI.
Here’s an example CORS configuration allowing
http://localhost:3000
to view and upload files:
In a production environment, replace
http://localhost:3000
with your actual domain
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need a table in Neon to store metadata about the objects uploaded to B2.
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a client like
psql
. Create a table including the B2 file name (object key), file URL, user ID, and timestamp:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
b2_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
object_key
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
-- Key (path/filename) in B2
file_url
TEXT
,
-- Base public URL
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Storing the full public
file_url
is only useful if the bucket is public. For private buckets, you'll typically only store the
object_key
and generate presigned download URLs on demand.
Run the SQL statement. Add other relevant columns as needed (e.g.,
content_type
,
size
if needed).
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, remember to apply appropriate access policies to the
b2_files
table. This controls who can view or modify the object references stored in Neon based on your RLS rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata in Neon. Access control for the objects within the B2 bucket itself is managed via B2 bucket settings (public/private), Application Key permissions, and presigned URL settings.
Upload files to B2 and store metadata in Neon
Leveraging B2's S3 compatibility, the recommended pattern for client-side uploads involves
presigned upload URLs
. Your backend generates a temporary URL that the client uses to upload the file directly to B2. Afterwards, your backend saves the file's metadata to Neon.
This requires two backend endpoints:
/presign-b2-upload
: Generates the temporary presigned URL.
/save-b2-metadata
: Records the metadata in Neon after the client confirms successful upload.
JavaScript
Python
We'll use
Hono
for the server,
@aws-sdk/client-s3
and
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
for B2 interaction (due to S3 compatibility), and
@neondatabase/serverless
for Neon.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install
@aws-sdk/client-s3
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
@neondatabase/serverless
@hono/node-server
hono
dotenv
Create a
.env
file:
# Backblaze B2 Credentials & Config
B2_APPLICATION_KEY_ID
=
your_b2_key_id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY
=
your_b2_application_key
B2_BUCKET_NAME
=
your_b2_bucket_name
B2_ENDPOINT_URL
=
https://your_b2_s3_endpoint
# Neon Connection String
DATABASE_URL
=
your_neon_database_connection_string

Explanation
Setup:
Initializes Neon (
sql
), Hono (
app
), and the AWS S3 client (
s3
) configured with the B2 endpoint, region (extracted from endpoint), and B2 Application Key credentials.
Authentication:
A placeholder
authMiddleware
is included.
Replace this with real authentication logic.
It currently just sets a static
userId
for demonstration.
Upload endpoints:
/presign-b2-upload
:
Generates a temporary secure URL (
presignedUrl
) using
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
that allows uploading a file directly to B2. It returns the URL, the generated
objectKey
, and the standard S3 public URL.
/save-b2-metadata
:
Called by the client after successful upload. Saves the
objectKey
,
file_url
, and
userId
into the
b2_files
table in Neon using
@neondatabase/serverless
.
Testing the upload workflow
Testing the presigned URL flow involves multiple steps:
Get presigned URL:
Send a
POST
request to your
/presign-b2-upload
endpoint with a JSON body containing
fileName
and
contentType
.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/presign-b2-upload
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"fileName": "test-b2.png", "contentType": "image/png"}'
You should receive a JSON response with a
presignedUrl
,
objectKey
, and
publicFileUrl
:
{
"success"
:
true
,
"presignedUrl"
:
"https://s3.<REGION>.backblazeb2.com/<BUCKET>/<OBJECT_KEY>?..."
,
"objectKey"
:
"<OBJECT_KEY>"
,
"publicFileUrl"
:
"https://s3.<REGION>.backblazeb2.com/<BUCKET>/<OBJECT_KEY>"
}
Note the
presignedUrl
,
objectKey
, and
publicFileUrl
from the response. You will use these in the next steps
Upload file to B2:
Use the received
presignedUrl
to upload the actual file using an HTTP
PUT
request. The
Content-Type
header must match the one used to generate the URL.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
PUT
"<PRESIGNED_URL>"
\
--upload-file
/path/to/your/test-b2.png
\
-H
"Content-Type: image/png"
Replace
<PRESIGNED_URL>
with the actual URL from step 1. A successful upload typically returns HTTP
200 OK
.
Save metadata:
Send a
POST
request to your
/save-b2-metadata
endpoint with the
objectKey
and optionally
publicFileUrl
from step 1.
Using cURL:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/save-b2-metadata
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"objectKey": "<OBJECT_KEY>", "publicFileUrl": "<PUBLIC_URL>"}'
You should receive a JSON response indicating success:
{
"success"
:
true
}
Expected outcome:
The file appears in your B2 bucket (check the Backblaze B2 web UI).
A new row appears in your
b2_files
table in Neon.
Accessing file metadata and files
Storing metadata in Neon allows your application to easily retrieve references to the files hosted on B2.
Query the
b2_files
table from your application's backend when needed.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve files for user 'user_123':
SELECT
id,
object_key,
-- Key (path/filename) in B2
file_url,
-- Base public URL (only useful if bucket is Public)
user_id,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
FROM
b2_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
;
-- Use actual authenticated user ID
Using the data:
The query returns metadata stored in Neon.
Accessing the file:
If your bucket is
Public
, you can use the
file_url
directly in your application (e.g.,
<img>
tags, download links).
If your bucket is
Private
, the stored
file_url
is likely irrelevant. You
must
generate a
presigned download URL
(a GET URL) on demand using your backend. This involves a similar process to generating the upload URL but using
GetObjectCommand
(JS) or
generate_presigned_url('get_object', ...)
(Python) with read permissions. This provides secure, temporary read access.
This pattern effectively separates file storage and delivery concerns (handled by Backblaze B2) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon), leveraging the strengths of both services.

Backup & Restore
new
Restore your branch from a point in time or snapshot
Snapshots in Early Access
The new
Backup & Restore
page in the Neon Console, which introduces the new
snapshots
feature, is available for members of our Early Access Program. Read more about joining up
here
.
Use the
Backup & Restore
page in the Neon Console to restore a branch to a previous state or create snapshots of your data. This feature combines
instant point-in-time restore
and
snapshots
to help you recover from accidental changes, data loss, or schema issues.
What you can do
✅ Instantly restore a branch
✅ Preview data before restoring
✅ Create snapshots
✅ Restore from a snapshot
Instantly restore a branch
Restore your branch to a specific time in its history. You can choose any timestamp within your
restore window
and preview data before restoring.
Available from
: Last 24 hours (Free Tier) or up to 7–30 days, depending on your Neon plan
How it works
: Select a time, preview the data, then restore
Select a time
Click the date & time selector, choose a restore time, and click
Restore
.
You'll see a confirmation modal that outlines what will happen:
Your branch will be restored to its state at the selected date & time
Your current branch will be saved as a backup, in case you want to revert
At this point, you can either proceed or select
Preview data
to inspect the data first.
Preview the data
Previewing lets you verify that you've selected the correct restore point. You can:
Browse data
in a
Tables
view
Query data
directly from the restore page
Compare schemas
using Neon’s schema diff tool
Browse data
Query data
Compare schemas
Browse data
lets you explore a read-only table view of your data at the selected restore point.
Restore
Click
Restore
to complete the restore operation, or
Cancel
to back out. You can also restore directly from any of the
Preview data
pages.
When you restore, a backup branch is automatically created (named
<branch_name>_old_<timestamp>
) in case you need to revert back. You can find this branch on the
Branches
page.
For information about removing backup branches, see
Deleting backup branches
.
Create snapshots
Snapshots are manual, point-in-time copies of your branch.
To create a snapshot, click
Create snapshot
. This captures the current state of your data and saves it as a
Manual snapshot
. It's a good idea to create a snapshot before making significant schema or data changes.
A future release will include a snapshot scheduler that lets you schedule daily, weekly, or monthly snapshots.
Restore from a snapshot
Restoring from a snapshot is a little different from the
instant branch restore
operation described above. When restoring from a snapshot, the snapshot is restored to a new branch, and you need to add a compute to the new branch to access it. Additionally, to start using the new branch with your application, you'll need to swap out your current connection string for the connection string of the new branch. Follow the steps below.
Select a snapshot
Find the
snapshot
you want to restore and click the
Restore
button.
A confirmation modal explains the operation:
The restore happens instantly
Your current branch is unchanged
A new branch with the restored data is created
Restore the snapshot
Click
Restore
to continue. You'll be redirected to the new branch created from the snapshot.
This is a new branch with the restored data
It doesn't have a compute yet — you’ll need to add one to access the data
Add a compute to the restore branch
Click
Add compute
to add a compute to the new branch.
Select your desired compute settings and click
Add
. Compute settings include compute size, autoscaling, and scale-to-zero. If you plan to switch over to this branch, you would typically use the same settings as the branch you will be replacing.
With a compute added, you can now access to your restore branch and connect to its databases.
Connect to the restore branch
With a compute added, you can:
Access the branch from the
Neon SQL Editor
Browse tables on the branch from the
Tables page
Connect from your app or Postgres client using the restore branch connection string
Click the
Connect
button to get the connection string.
The restore branch connection string differs from the snapshot's source branch. It has a different hostname because each Neon branch is a separate Postgres instance.
Switch your app to the restore branch
If you want to use the restore branch with your application, update your app to use the restore branch connection string. Before switching, pause write operations on the branch you are replacing, then resume them after switching to avoid data inconsistencies. Since Neon doesn't support read-only mode at the branch or database level, you'll need disable writes in your application.
The restore branch name includes a timestamp and may be long. You can rename it. See
Rename a branch
for instructions.

Learn how to create an automatic audit trail for your Postgres database with Bemi
Bemi
is an open-source solution that plugs into Postgres and ORMs such as Prisma, TypeORM, SQLAlchemy, and Ruby on Rails to track database changes automatically. It unlocks robust context-aware audit trails and time travel querying inside your application.
Designed with simplicity and non-invasiveness in mind, Bemi doesn't require alterations to your existing database structure. It operates in the background, empowering you with data change tracking features.
In this guide, we'll show you how to connect your Neon database to Bemi to create an automatic audit trail.
Prerequisites
A
Bemi account
A
Neon account
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Enable logical replication in Neon
Bemi tracks changes made in a Postgres database through Change Data Capture (CDC), which is a process of identifying and capturing changes made to your database tables in real-time. In Postgres, CDC is supported by the Postgres logical replication feature. In this step, we'll enable logical replication for your Neon Postgres project.
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from replica to logical for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to logical, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Connect your Neon database to Bemi
The following instructions assume you are connecting with a Postgres role created via the Neon Console, API, or CLI. These roles are automatically granted membership in a
neon_superuser
group, which has the Postgres
REPLICATION
privilege. The role you use to connect to Bemi requires this privilege. If you prefer to create a dedicated read-only role for use with Bemi, see
Use a read-only Postgres role for Bemi
.
To connect your database to Bemi:
In Neon, retrieve your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It will look similar to this:
postgresql:
//
neondb_owner:AbC123dEf@ep
-
cool
-
darkness
-
123456
.us
-
east
-
2
.aws.neon.tech
/
neondb?sslmode
=
require
In Bemi, select
Databases
>
Add Database
to open the
Connect PostgreSQL Database
dialog.
Enter the Neon database connection details from your connection string. For example, given the connection string shown above, enter the details in the
Connect PostgreSQL Database
dialog as shown below. Your values will differ except for the port number. Neon uses the default Postgres port,
5432
.
Host
: ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
Port
: 5432
Database Name
: neondb
Username
: neondb_owner
Password
: AbC123dEf
You can also use the
Environment
field to specify whether the configuration is for a
Production
,
Staging
, or
Test
environment.
After entering your connection details, click
Add Database
.
Configure the tables you want to track changes for and choose whether to track new tables automatically. You can change this selection later, if necessary.
Click
Save
to continue.
Wait a few minutes while Bemi provisions the infrastructure. When this operation completes, you’ve successfully configured a Bemi Postgres source for your Neon database. You'll be able to track data changes through the Bemi Browser UI page, where you can filter by
Operation
(
Create
,
Update
,
Delete
),
Table
, or
Primary Key
. You can also view data changes by environment if you have configured more than one.
Use a read-only Postgres role for Bemi
If preferred, you can create a dedicated read-only Postgres role for connecting your Neon database to Bemi. To do so, run the commands below. The commands assume your database resides in the
public
schema in Postgres. If your database resides in a different schema, adjust the commands as necessary to specify the correct schema name.
CREATE ROLE
: Creates a new read-only user for Bemi to read database changes.
CREATE PUBLICATION
: creates a "channel" that we'll subscribe to and track changes in real-time.
REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
: enhances records stored in WAL to record the previous state (“before”) in addition to the tracked by default new state (“after”).
-- Create read-only user with REPLICATION permission
CREATE
ROLE

, current_tablename);
END
LOOP
;
END
$$
LANGUAGE
plpgsql;
-- Call the created procedure
CALL
_bemi_set_replica_identity();
note
After creating a read-only role, you can find the connection details for this role by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Use this role when connecting your Neon database to Bemi, as described
above
.
Allow inbound traffic
If you're using Neon's IP Allow feature, available with the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plans, to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Bemi.
Contact Bemi
to get the static IPs that need to be allowlisted. For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see
Configure IP Allow

Benchmarking latency in Neon's serverless Postgres
Techniques for obtaining meaningful latency data in serverless database environments
Benchmarking database query latency is inherently complex, requiring careful consideration of numerous variables and testing methodologies. Neon's serverless Postgres environment adds additional layers to this complexity due to compute auto-suspension, connection protocol differences, and geographic distribution. This guide provides detailed methodologies for separating cold-start costs from operational latency, selecting optimal connection types, and designing tests that accurately reflect production conditions.
Understanding cold vs. hot queries
When benchmarking Neon databases, you'll encounter two distinct types of queries:
Cold queries
: Occur when a previously suspended compute resource is activated to process a request. This activation typically adds a few hundred milliseconds of latency. Cold queries are common in development or test environments where databases aren't running continuously.
Hot queries
: Execute on an already-active database instance, delivering consistent low latency. These represent typical performance in production environments where databases run continuously or remain active most of the time.
Free-tier Neon databases automatically suspend after 5 minutes of inactivity. Paid plans allow you to configure or disable the auto-suspend timeout, enabling you to customize your testing approach or eliminate cold starts entirely. See
Compute Lifecycle
and
Auto-suspend Configuration
for more details.
Benchmarking methodology
For accurate benchmarking, always measure cold and hot queries separately:
Cold query testing
:
Ensure your database is in a suspended state
Make a request to trigger compute activation
Measure this connection time, which includes the startup overhead
Hot query testing
:
After triggering compute activation with a cold query
Make subsequent requests within the active window
Measure these connection times, which reflect normal operation
This methodology isolates the cold start overhead from normal operating performance, giving you a clearer picture of both typical performance and worst-case latency.
Testing environment considerations
Before running benchmarks, determine exactly what kind of latency you want to measure:
Server-to-database latency
: If you're testing how quickly your application server can communicate with Neon, run benchmarks from the same location as your server. This is typically the most relevant metric for API performance.
Client-to-database latency
: If you're testing direct client connections (rare in production), benchmark from client locations.
Once you've determined what you're measuring:
Test from your production region
: Geographic proximity is the primary factor in connection latency. Run benchmarks from the same region as your production environment to get accurate results. If your Neon database is in
us-east-1
, execute benchmarks from a server in that AWS region.
Avoid localhost testing
: Testing from your local workstation doesn't reflect real-world conditions. In production, databases are typically queried from deployed servers, not client machines.
Avoid testing across unrealistic distances that don't represent your production setup, as this introduces network overhead your users won't experience. For more on geographic factors affecting latency, see
Connection Latency and Timeouts
.
Connection types and their impact
Neon's serverless driver
supports two connection protocols: HTTP and WebSocket, each with distinctly different performance profiles. While some modern edge platforms now support direct TCP connections, many serverless environments still have limitations around persistent connections or TCP support. Neon's HTTP and WebSocket methods work across all serverless platforms, with each protocol having different latency characteristics and feature trade-offs depending on your query patterns. Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate benchmarking. For a comprehensive comparison, see
Choosing Connection Types
.
HTTP connections
Performance profile
: Optimized for queries with minimal connection overhead
Use cases
:
Serverless functions that need low-latency query execution
Applications running multiple queries in parallel (HTTP can outperform WebSockets for parallel execution)
Scenarios where queries don't depend on each other
Limitations
: Doesn't support sessions, interactive transactions, NOTIFY, or COPY protocol
When to benchmark
: Use for measuring performance of stateless query operations, both individual and parallel
Optimization
: Connection caching can further reduce latency
WebSocket connections
Performance profile
: Higher initial connection overhead but significantly faster for subsequent queries
Use cases
: Optimal for applications that execute multiple queries over a maintained connection
Features
: Supports full Postgres functionality including sessions, transactions, and all Postgres protocols
When to benchmark
: Measure both connection establishment time and subsequent query execution separately
Initialization
: Requires multiple round-trips between client and server to establish
Benchmarking different connection types
When comparing HTTP vs WebSocket connections, you'll typically observe different latency patterns:
HTTP connections
: Show consistent low latency for individual queries and excel at parallel query execution
WebSocket connections
: Show higher initial connection latency (about 3-5x slower than HTTP) but very low latency for subsequent sequential queries
Consider your query patterns when choosing a connection type:
For parallel queries or independent operations, HTTP often performs better
For sequential queries where each depends on the previous result, WebSockets can be more efficient after the initial connection
The break-even point typically occurs around 2-3 sequential queries, though this varies by region and workload
The runtime environment (Edge vs traditional serverless) can also impact connection performance characteristics.
Testing approach:
For WebSockets: Establish the connection first, then measure query execution time separately. This reflects real-world usage where connections are reused.
For HTTP: Measure individual query execution time including any per-query connection overhead.
For implementation details on both connection methods, refer to the
Serverless Driver Documentation
.
Real-world usage pattern simulation
Design your benchmarks to simulate how your application actually interacts with Neon:
Use persistent connections
: For web servers or long-running applications, initialize the database connection before measuring query timings. Run a series of queries on this persistent connection. If your production environment uses connection pooling (which reuses database connections across requests), ensure your benchmarks account for this - pooled connections significantly reduce connection overhead after initial pool creation. See
Connection Pooling
for implementation details.
Avoid one-query-per-process testing
: While useful for understanding cold starts, simplistic tests that connect, query, and disconnect don't reflect long-running application performance.
Match your application pattern
:
If your app keeps connections alive, focus on post-connection query latency
If your app is serverless and frequently creates new connections, measure both scenarios but analyze them separately
For examples of different connection patterns and their implementation, see
Connection Examples
.
Neon latency benchmarks dashboard
Neon provides a
Latency Benchmarks Dashboard
that measures latency between serverless functions and Neon databases across different regions. The benchmark specifically tracks:
Roundtrip time for executing simple SELECT queries
Network latency between function and database regions
Database connection establishment time
Performance differences between HTTP and WebSocket connections
Cold vs hot query performance
This data helps you understand expected latencies based on your specific region and connection method. The dashboard is open source and
available on GitHub
.
If you encounter unexpected results during your benchmarking, consult the
Connection Troubleshooting
documentation to identify potential issues.
Conclusion
Benchmarking Neon requires understanding the unique characteristics of serverless Postgres. By separating cold and hot query measurements, testing from appropriate locations, and selecting the right connection methods, you'll obtain accurate performance metrics that reflect what your applications will experience in production.

To minimize storage costs, Neon automatically archives branches that are:
Older than
14 days
.
Have not been accessed for the past
24 hours
Both conditions must be true for a branch to be archived.
However, a branch

learn more
).
note
If your Neon project was inactive for more than a week before the introduction of branch archiving on November 11, 2024, the thresholds mentioned above do not come into effect until the next time you access branches in your project.
Unarchiving a branch
No action is required to unarchive a branch. It happens automatically.
Connecting to an archived branch, querying it, or performing some other action that accesses it will trigger the unarchive process. Branches with large amounts of data may experience slightly slower connection and query times while a branch is being unarchived.
For projects on paid Neon plans, there is a limit of
100 unarchived branches per project
. If a project reaches this limit, Neon archives branches
without waiting
for the 14-day or 24-hour archiving criteria described above.
note
When a branch is unarchived, its parent branches, all the way up to the root branch, are also unarchived.
The following actions will automatically unarchive a branch, transferring the branch's data back to regular Neon storage:
Connecting to or querying the branch from a client or application
Querying the branch from the Neon SQL Editor
Viewing the branch on the Tables page in the Neon Console
Creating a child branch
Creating a role on a branch
Creating a database on a branch
Reset the branch from its parent
Performing a restore operation on a branch
Setting the branch as protected
Running
Neon CLI
commands or
Neon API
calls that access the branch
Identifying archived branches
Archived branches can be identified by an archive icon on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console:
If you select an archived branch on the
Branches
page to view its details, you can see when the branch was archived:
Archive and unarchive operations can also be monitored in the Neon Console or using the Neon API. See
Monitoring branch archiving
.
About archive storage
For Neon projects created in AWS regions, inactive branches are archived in Amazon S3 storage. For Neon projects created in Azure regions, branches are archived in Azure Blob storage. For more information about how archive storage works in Neon, refer to
Archive storage
in our architecture documentation.
Is branch archiving configurable?
Branch archiving thresholds are not configurable. Archiving and unarchiving happen automatically according to the thresholds and conditions described above.
Disabling branch archiving
You cannot fully disable branch archiving, but you can prevent a branch from being archived by defining it as a
protected branch
. For instructions, see
Set a branch as protected
. Protected branches are supported on Neon paid plans.
Monitoring branch archiving
You can monitor branch archive and unarchive operations from the
System operations
tab on the
Monitoring
page in the Neon Console. Look for the following operations:
Timeline archive
: The time when the branch archive operation was initiated
Timeline unarchive
: The time when the branch unarchive operation was initiated
For related information, see
System operations
.
You can also monitor branch archiving using the Neon CLI or Neon API.

Instant restore
Learn how to revert changes or recover lost data using Neon's instant restore with Time Travel Assist
What You'll Learn
Restore data to any point in time
Querying historical data
Related docs
Configure restore window
With Neon's instant restore capability, also known as point-in-time restore or PITR, you can easily restore a branch to an earlier state in its own or another branch's history. You can use Time Travel Assist to connect to a specific point in your restore window, where you can run read-only queries to pinpoint the exact moment you need to restore to. You can also use Schema Diff to get a side-by-side, GitHub-style visual comparison of your selected branches before restoring.
How instant restore works
Restore from history
The restore operation lets you revert the state of a selected branch to an earlier point in time in its own or another branch's history, using time and date or Log Sequence Number (LSN). For example, you can revert to a state just before a data loss occurred.
The default restore window for a Neon project differs by plan. You can revert a branch to any time within your configured
restore window
, down to the millisecond.
A few key points to keep in mind about the restore operation:
Restore backups are created automatically in case you make a mistake
Current data is overwritten
All databases on a branch are restored
Connections to the selected branch are temporarily interrupted
Automatic backups
In case you need to rollback a restore, Neon preserves the branch's final state before the restore operation in an automatically created backup branch, which takes the following format:
{
branch_name}_old_
{head_timestamp}
You can use this backup to rollback the restore operation if necessary. The backup branches are listed on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console among your other branches.
The backup becomes the parent of your original branch, which makes rolling back the restore operation simple:
Reset from parent
.
Overwrite, not a merge
It is important to understand that whenever you restore a branch, you are performing a
complete
overwrite, not a merge or refresh. Everything on your current branch, data and schema, is replaced with the contents from the historical source. All data changes from the selected restore point onwards are excluded from the branch.
Changes apply to all databases
A reminder that in Neon's
object hierarchy
, a branch can include any number of databases. Keep this in mind when restoring branches. For example, let's say you want to restore lost data in a given database. If you restore your branch to an earlier point in time before the data loss occurred, the operation applies to
all
databases on the branch, not just the one you are troubleshooting. You can expect the restore operation to last a few seconds.
In general, Neon recommends that you avoid creating too many databases in a single Neon project. If you have multiple, distinct applications, each one deserves its own Neon project. A good rule of thumb: use one Neon project per source code repository.
Connections temporarily interrupted
Existing connections to the selected branch are temporarily interrupted during the restore operation. However, your connection details do not change. Applications can automatically re-establish their database connections as soon as the restore operation is finished.
Technical details
Neon is open source and built in public, so if you are interested in understanding the technical implementation behind instant restore, see the details below.
View technical details
Similar to the manual restore operation using the Neon Console and API described
here
, the Restore operation performs a similar set of actions, but automatically:
On initiating a restore action, Neon builds a new point-in-time branch by matching your selected timestamp to the corresponding LSN of the relevant entries in the shared WAL record.
The compute for your initial branch is moved to this new branch so that your connection string remains stable.
We rename your new branch to the exact name as your initial branch, so the effect is seamless; it looks and acts like the same branch.
Your initial branch, which now has no compute attached to it, is renamed to
branch_name_old_head_timestamp
to keep the pre-restore branch available should you need to roll back. Note that the initial branch was the parent for your new branch, and this is reflected when you look at your branch details.
Time Travel Assist
Use Time Travel Assist to make sure you've targeted the correct restore point before you restore your branch.
See
Time Travel Assist
to learn more.
How to use instant restore
You can use the Neon Console, CLI, or API to restore branches.
Console
CLI
API
Restoring from history
Use the
Restore
page to restore a branch to an earlier timestamp in its history.
First, select the
Branch to restore
. This is the target branch for the restore operation.
To restore a branch from its own history:
Make sure the
From history
tab is selected.
Choose your timestamp or switch to LSN.
Click
Next
.
A confirmation window opens giving you details about the pending restore operation. Review these details to make sure you've made the correct selections.
Click
Restore
to complete the operation.
To restore from another branch:
Switch to the
From another branch
tab.
Select the source branch that you want to restore data from.
By default, the operation pulls the latest data from the source branch. If you want to pull from an earlier point in time, disable
Restore from latest data (head)
.
The timestamp selector will appear.
Choose your timestamp or switch to the LSN input.
Click
Next
, confirm the details of the operation, then click
Restore
to complete.
All databases on the selected branch are instantly updated with the data and schema from the chosen point in time. From the
Branches
page, you can now see a backup branch was created with the state of the branch at the restore point in time.
To make sure you choose the right restore point, we encourage you to use
Time Travel Assist
before running a restore job, but the backup branch is there if you need it.
If you do need to revert your changes, you can
Reset from parent
since that is your branch's relationship to the restore point backup.
Deleting backup branches
You can delete a backup branch created by a restore operation on your project's root branch. Your project's root branch is typically named
production
unless you've renamed it. However, removing a backup branch created by a restore operation on a non-root branch (a child branch of
production
) is not yet supported.
To delete a backup branch:
Navigate to the
Branches
page.
Find the backup branch you want to delete. It will have a name with the following format, where
branch_name
is typically
production
.
{
branch_name}_old_
{head_timestamp}
Select
Delete
from the menu.
If you cannot delete a backup branch because the backup branch was created by a restore operation on a non-root branch, you can still free up its storage space. If you're certain you no longer need the data in a backup branch, connect to the branch and drop its databases or tables.
Be sure to connect to the correct branch when doing this
. You can connect to a backup branch just like any other branch via the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client like
psql
.
To keep your
Branches
page organized, consider renaming backup branches that you plan to keep. For example, you can prefix their names with a
z
to move them to the bottom of the list. See
Rename a branch
for details.
Billing considerations
There are minimal impacts to billing from the instant restore and Time Travel Assist features:
Instant restore
— The backups created when you restore a branch do add to your total number of branches, but since they do not have a compute attached they do not add to consumption costs.
Time Travel Assist
— Costs related to Time Travel queries are minimal. See
Billing considerations
.
Limitations
Deleting backup branches is only supported for backups created by restore operations on root branches. See
Deleting backup branches
for details.
Reset from parent
restores from the parent branch, which may be a backup branch if you performed a restore operation on the parent branch.
For example, let's say you have a
production
branch with a child development branch
development
. You are working on
development
and decide to restore to an earlier point in time to fix something during development. At this point,
development
's parent switches from
production
to the backup
development_old_timestamp
. A day later, you want to refresh
development
with the latest data from
production
. You can't use
Reset from parent
, since the backup is now the parent. Instead, use
Instant restore
and select the original parent
production
as the source.

Schema Diff action
This action performs a database schema diff on specified Neon branches for each pull request and writes comment to the pull request in GitHub highlighting the schema differences.
It supports workflows where schema changes are made on a branch. When you create or update a pull request containing schema changes, the action automatically generates a comment within the pull request. By including the schema diff as part of the comment, reviewers can easily assess the changes directly within the pull request.
GitHub Actions Marketplace
You can find this action on the
GitHub Actions Marketplace
:
Neon Schema Diff GitHub Action
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
.
You will need to add your Neon API key to your GitHub repository secrets. See
Add a Neon API key to your GitHub repository secrets
for instructions.
You can easily set up the prerequisites mentioned above using our
GitHub integration
, which takes care of the entire process and automatically.
Example
The following example performs a schema diff on a database named
mydatabase
between the
compare_branch
and the
base_branch
branch.
steps
:
-
uses
:
neondatabase/schema-diff-action@v1
with
:
project_id
:
${{ vars.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
compare_branch
:
preview/pr-${{ github.event.number }}-${{ needs.setup.outputs.branch }}
base_branch
:
production
api_key
:
${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
database
:
mydatabase
username
:
myrole
Here's an example workflow that incorporates the action:

:

:

with
:
project_id
:
${{ vars.NEON_PROJECT_ID }}
compare_branch
:
preview/pr-${{ github.event.number }}
base_branch
:
production
api_key
:
${{ secrets.NEON_API_KEY }}
database
:
mydatabase
username
:
myrole
In this workflow, the action is triggered by pull request events such as
opened
,
reopened
, or
synchronize
(when new commits are pushed to an existing PR).
The branches to compare are specified by the
compare_branch
and
base_branch
inputs.
The
compare_branch
is the branch linked to the pull request — it's the "downstream" dev branch that contains your proposed schema changes, and is typically created by the
Create branch
action and defined by
preview/pr-${{ github.event.number }}
in the example above.
The
base_branch
is the branch you are merging into. It's the "upstream" branch used as the reference point for the comparison. If you don’t explicitly specify the
base_branch
, the action defaults to comparing the
compare_branch
with its parent branch. The
base_branch
branch is usually named
production
, which is default name of the root branch created with each Neon project.
The
database
is the name of the database containing the schema to be compared.
The
username
is the name of the Postgres role that owns the database.
permissions
allows comments to be written on pull requests and repository contents to be read. These permissions are necessary if, for example, you need to check out your branch to run migrations.
permissions
:
pull-requests
:
write
contents
:
read
With the permissions above you will only allow read access to repository contents (needed to checkout the current branch, for example) and write access to pull requests.
After performing the schema diff comparison:
The action generates an SQL patch summarizing the changes if there are schema differences between the branches.
The action then posts a comment to the pull request containing the details of the schema diff.
Instead of spamming the PR with multiple comments, the action updates the same comment to reflect any changes as new commits are pushed.
If there are no schema differences between the
compare_branch
and the
base_branch
, the action doesn't add or update a comment, keeping your PR clean.

Add a Neon API key to your GitHub repository secrets
Using Neon's GitHub Actions requires adding a Neon API key to your GitHub repository secrets. There
are two ways you can perform this setup:
Using the Neon GitHub Integration
(recommended) — this integration
connects your Neon project to your GitHub repository, creates an API key, and
sets the API key in your GitHub repository for you. See
Neon GitHub Integration
for
instructions.
Manual setup
— this method requires obtaining a Neon API key and
configuring it manually in your GitHub repository.
Obtain a Neon API key. See
Create an API key
for instructions.
In your GitHub repository, go to
Project settings
and locate
Secrets
at the bottom of the left sidebar.
Click
Actions
>
New Repository Secret
.
Name the secret
NEON_API_KEY
and paste your API key in the
Secret
field
Click
Add Secret
.

Branching with the Neon API
Learn how to create and delete branches with the Neon API
The examples in this guide demonstrate creating, viewing, and deleting branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
note
The API examples that follow may only show some of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
program specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the examples below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.
Create a branch with the API
The following Neon API method creates a branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
POST
/projects/{project_id}/branches
The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command:
note
This method does not require a request body. Without a request body, the method creates a branch from the project's default branch, and a compute is not created.
curl
'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/<project_id>/branches'
\
-H
'Accept: application/json'
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/json'
\
-d
'{
"endpoints": [
{
"type": "read_write"
}
],
"branch": {
"parent_id": "br-wispy-dew-591433"
}
}'
|
jq
The
project_id
for a Neon project is found on the
Settings
page in the Neon Console, or you can find it by listing the projects for your Neon account using the Neon API. It is a generated value that looks something like this:
autumn-disk-484331
.
The
endpoints
attribute creates a compute, which is required to connect to the branch. Neon supports
read_write
and
read_only
compute types. A branch can be created with or without a compute. You can specify
read_only
to create a
read replica
.
The
branch
attribute specifies the parent branch.
The
parent_id
can be obtained by listing the branches for your project. See
List branches
. The
parent_id
is the
id
of the branch you are branching from. A branch
id
has a
br-
prefix. You can branch from your Neon project's default branch or a non-default branch.
The response includes information about the branch, the branch's compute, and the
create_branch
and
start_compute
operations that were initiated.

Branching with the Neon CLI
Learn how to create and delete branches with the Neon CLI
The examples in this guide demonstrate creating, viewing, and deleting branches using the Neon CLI. For other branch-related CLI commands, refer to
Neon CLI commands — branches
. This guide also describes how to use the
--api-key
option to authenticate CLI branching commands from the command line.
The examples show the default
table
output format. The Neon CLI also supports
json
and
yaml
output formats. For example, if you prefer output in
json
, add
--output json
to your Neon CLI command.
Prerequisites
The Neon CLI. See
Install the Neon CLI
for instructions.
To run CLI commands, you must either authenticate through your browser or supply an API key using the
--api-key
option. See
Connect with the Neon CLI
.
Create a branch with the CLI
The following Neon CLI command creates a branch. If your Neon account has more than one project, you will be required to specify a project ID using the
--project-id
option. To view the CLI documentation for this command, refer to the
Neon CLI reference
.
The command response includes the branch ID, the compute endpoint ID, and the connection URI for connecting to the branch.
tip
You can use the
--name
option with a
neon branches create
command to specify your own branch name instead of using the name generated by Neon. For example:
neon branches create --name mybranch
. Also, for any Neon CLI command, you can specify
--output json
to change the command output from the default table format to JSON format.

The Neon CLI provides a
neon connection-string
command you can use to extract a connection uri programmatically. See
Neon CLI commands — connection-string
.
Create a branch from a non-default parent
Using the option
--parent
, you can specify any non-default branch that you want to use as the parent for your new branch, depending on the needs of your development workflow.
In this example, we're creating a hotfix branch called
hotfix/critical-fix
using the
development
branch as the parent:

Branching automation with the Neon CLI
The Neon CLI enables easy automation of branching operations for integration into your workflows or toolchains. To facilitate authentication to Neon when running a CLI command, the Neon CLI allows you to use an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
.
To use an API key, you can store it in an environment variable on your system. This prevents the key from being hardcoded into your automation scripts or exposed in another way. For example, you can add the following line to your shell's profile file (
.bashrc
or
.bash_profile
for bash shell):
export
NEON_API_KEY
=<
neon_api_key
>
After exporting your key, source the profile file (source
~/.bashrc
or source
~/.bash_profile
), or start a new terminal session.
You do not need to specify the variable name explicitly when using a Neon CLI command. A Neon CLI command looks for a
NEON_API_KEY
variable setting by default.
This API key configuration ensures that the API key is kept secure while still providing a way to authenticate your CLI commands. Remember, you should handle your API key with the same level of security as your other credentials.
Resetting a branch from its parent
Depending on your development workflow, you might need to periodically reset a branch to match the latest state of its parent. This is useful, for example, when resetting a development branch back to the production branch before starting work on a new feature.
Use the following command to reset a branch to the current state (HEAD) of its parent branch:
neon
branches
reset
<
id
|
name
>
--parent
Example:
This example resets a feature branch to match the latest state of its parent branch:
neon
branches
reset
feature/user-auth
--parent

If the branch you want to reset has child branches, you need to include the
preserve-under-name
parameter. This will save the current state of your branch under a new name before performing the reset. The child branches will then show this newly named branch as their parent. This step ensures that your original branch can be reset cleanly, as all child branches will have been transferred to the new parent name.
For example, here we are resetting
feature/user-auth
to its parent while preserving its latest state under the branch name
feature/user-auth-backup
:
neon
branches
reset
feature/user-auth
--parent
--preserve-under-name
feature/user-auth-backup

Restoring a branch to its own or another branch's history
Using the CLI, you can restore a branch to an earlier point in its history or another branch's history using the following command:
neon
branches
restore
<
target
id
|
name
>
<
source
id
|
name
@
timestamp
|

>
This command restores the branch
production
to an earlier timestamp in its own history, saving to a backup branch called
production_restore_backup_2024-02-20
neon
branches
restore

Schema-only branches
Protect sensitive data with schema-only branches
Early Access
This feature is available for members of our
Early Access Program
. Read more about joining up
here
.
Neon supports creating schema-only branches, letting you create branches that replicate only the database schema from a source branch — without copying any of the actual data. This feature is ideal for working with confidential information. Instead of duplicating this sensitive data, you can now create a branch with just the database structure and populate it with randomized or anonymized data instead. This provides your team with a secure and compliant environment for developing and testing using Neon branches.
Creating schema-only branches
You can create schema-only branches in the Neon Console or using the Neon API, in much the same way you create any Neon branch. Support for the Neon CLI will come in a future release.
Neon Console
CLI
API
To create a schema-only branch from the Neon Console:
In the console, select your project.
Select
Branches
.
Click
Create branch
to open the branch creation dialog.
Under
Include
, Select the
Schema-only
option.
Provide a name for the branch.
In the
From Branch
field, select the source branch. The schema from the source branch will be copied to your new schema-only branch.
Click
Create branch
.
Schema-only branching example
To try out schema-only branches:
Start by creating an
employees
table on your Neon project's
main
branch and adding some dummy data. You can do this from the
Neon SQL Editor
or any SQL client by copying and pasting the following statements:
CREATE
TABLE
employees
(
employee_id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
first_name
VARCHAR
(
50
),
last_name

Navigate to the
Tables
page in the Neon Console, and select your
main
branch from the bread-crumb menu at the top of the console. Your
employees
table will have both schema and data, as shown here:
Create a schema-only branch following the instructions above. See
Creating schema-only branches
. In this example, we've named the branch
employees_schema_only
.
On the
Tables
page, select your newly created
employees_schema_only
branch from the bread-crumb menu at the top of the console. You can see that the schema-only branch contains the schema, but no data. The same will be true for any table in any database on the schema-only branch — only the schema will be present.
Connect to a schema-only branch
Connecting to a schema-only branch works the same way as connecting to any Neon branch. You'll connect via a compute associated with the branch. Follow these steps to connect using
psql
and a connection string obtained from the Neon Console.
In the Neon Console, select a project.
From the project
Dashboard
, click
Connect
, and select your schema-only branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
Copy the connection string. A connection string includes your role name, the compute hostname, and the database name.
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
What's different about schema-only branches?
Unlike other branches, schema-only branches do not have a parent branch, as you can see below. Both the
main
branch of the project and the schema-only branch have no parent, indicated by the dash in the
Parent
column (
-
) on the
Branches
page in your Neon project.
Schema-only branches are independent
root branches
, just like the
production
branch in your Neon project. When you create a schema-only branch, you're creating a new
root branch
.
Key points about schema-only branches
No parent branch
: Schema-only branches are root branches. They do not have a parent branch.
No shared history
: Data added to a schema-only branch is independent and adds to your storage. There is no shared history with a parent.
Reset from parent is not supported
: With no parent branch,
reset from parent
operations are not supported.
Restore is supported, but...
performing a
restore
operation on a schema-only branch copies both schema and data from the source branch.
Branch protection is supported
: Like any other branch, you can enable
branch protection
for schema-only branches.
Schema-only branch allowances
There are certain allowances associated with schema-only branches:
A schema-only branch is a
root branch
, and only a certain number of root branches are permitted per Neon project, depending on your Neon plan.
The
main
root branch created with each Neon project counts toward the
root branch allowance per project
, as do certain
backup branches
created by restore operations.
On the Free plan, all branches share a total storage limit of 0.5 GB. Schema-only branches count toward this limit like any other branch. On paid plans, storage limits are higher, but each schema-only branch has a maximum storage allowance, as outlined in the following table.
Plan
Root branch allowance per project
Maximum storage allowance per schema-only branch
Free
3
0.5 GB
Launch
5
3 GB
Scale
10
5 GB
Business
25
20 GB
Once you use up your root branch allowance, you will not be able to create additional schema-only branches. You will be required to remove existing root branches first.

Branching — Testing queries
Create a Neon branch to test queries before running them in production
Complex queries that modify data or alter schemas have the potential to be destructive. It is advisable to test these types of queries before running them in production. On other database systems, testing potentially destructive queries can be time and resource intensive. For example, testing may involve setting up a separate database instance and replicating data. With Neon, you can instantly create a database branch with a full copy-on-write clone of your production data in just a few clicks. When you finish testing, you can remove the branch just as easily.
working with sensitive data?
Neon also supports schema-only branching.

This guide walks you through creating a branch of your production data, testing a potentially destructive query, and deleting the branch when you are finished.
Create a test branch

For the purpose of this guide, let's assume you have a database in Neon with the following table and data:
CREATE
TABLE
Post
(
id

PRIMARY KEY
,
title
VARCHAR
(
255
),

);
Create a test branch
In the Neon Console, select your project.
Select
Branches
.
Click
Create branch
to open the branch creation dialog.
Enter a name for the branch. This guide uses the name
my_test_branch
.
Select a parent branch. Select the branch defined as your default branch.
Under
Include data up to
, select the
Current point in time
option to create a branch with the latest available data from the parent branch (the default).
Click
Create new branch
to create your branch.
You are directed to the
Branches
page where you are shown the details for your new branch.
You can also create a test branch using the
Neon CLI
or
Neon API
.
CLI
API
neon
branches
create
--project-id
<
project-i
d
>
--name
my_test_branch
Test your query
Navigate to the
SQL Editor
, select the test branch, and run your query. For example, perhaps you are deleting blog posts from your database for a certain author published before a certain date, and you want to make sure the query only removes the intended records.
DELETE
FROM
Post
WHERE
author_name
=
'Alice'
AND
date_published
<
'2020-01-01'
;
Next, inspect the data to ensure the intended records were deleted, while others remained unaffected. This query allows you to quickly see if the number of records matches your expectations:
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
Post;
Before the
DELETE
query, there were 5 records. If the query ran correctly, this should now show 4.
Delete the test branch
When you finish testing your query, you can delete the test branch:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
.
Select the test branch from the table.
From the
Actions
menu on the branch overview page, select
Delete
.
You can also delete a branch using the
Neon CLI
or

Use Neon with Cloudflare Hyperdrive
Connect Cloudflare Hyperdrive to your Neon Postgres database for faster queries
Cloudflare Hyperdrive
is a serverless application that proxies queries to your database and accelerates them. It works by maintaining a globally distributed pool of database connections, and routing queries to the closest available connection.
This is specifically useful for serverless applications that cannot maintain a persistent database connection and need to establish a new connection for each request. Hyperdrive can significantly reduce the latency of these queries for your application users.
This guide demonstrates how to configure a Hyperdrive service to connect to your Neon Postgres database. It demonstrates how to implement a regular
Workers
application that connects to Neon directly and then replace that connection with a
Hyperdrive
connection to achieve performance improvements.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you require:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A Cloudflare account. If you do not have one, sign up for
Cloudflare Workers
to get started.
NOTE
: You need to be on Cloudflare Workers' paid subscription plan to use Hyperdrive.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and deploy our Workers application.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Click the
New Project
button to create a new project.
From your project dashboard, navigate to the
SQL Editor
from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:
CREATE
TABLE
books_to_read
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
title
TEXT
,
author
TEXT
);
Next, we insert some sample data into the
books_to_read
table, so we can query it later:
INSERT INTO
books_to_read (title, author)
VALUES
(
'The Way of Kings'
,
'Brandon Sanderson'
),
(
'The Name of the Wind'
,
'Patrick Rothfuss'
),
(
'Coders at Work'
,
'Peter Seibel'
),
(
'1984'
,
'George Orwell'
);
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Log in to your
Project Dashboard
in the Neon Console and open the
Connect to your database
modal to find your database connection string. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://neondb_owner:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Setting up your Cloudflare Workers application
Create a new Worker project
Run the following command in a terminal window to set up a new Cloudflare Workers project:
npm
create
cloudflare@latest
This initiates an interactive CLI prompt to generate a new project. To follow along with this guide, you can use the following settings:
├
In
which
directory
do
you
want
to
create
your
application?
│
dir
./neon-hyperdrive-guide
│
├
What
type
of
application
do
you
want
to
create?
│
type
"Hello World"
Worker
│
├
Do
you
want
to
use
TypeScript?
│
Yes
typescript
When asked if you want to deploy your application, select
no
. We'll develop and test the application locally before deploying it to the Cloudflare Workers platform.
The
create-cloudflare
CLI also installs the
Wrangler
tool to manage the full workflow of testing and managing your Worker applications. To emulate the Node environment in the Workers runtime, we need to add the following entry to the
wrangler.toml
file.
#:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
name
=
"with-hyperdrive"
main
=
"src/index.ts"
compatibility_date
=
"2024-12-05"
compatibility_flags
=
[
"nodejs_compat"
]
Implement the Worker script
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
postgres.js
node-postgres
npm
install
postgres
Now, you can update the
src/index.js
file in the project directory with the following code:
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
postgres
from
'postgres'
;
export
default
{
async
fetch
(request
,
env
,
ctx) {
const
sql
=
postgres
(
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
rows
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM books_to_read`
;
return
new
Response
(
JSON
.stringify
(rows));
}
,
};
The
fetch
handler defined above gets called when the worker receives an HTTP request. It will query the Neon database to fetch the full list of books in our to-read list.
Test the worker application locally
First, you need to configure the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to point to the Neon database. You can do this by creating a
.dev.vars
file at the root of the project directory with the following content:
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
Now, to test the worker application locally, you can use the
wrangler
CLI which comes with the Cloudflare project setup.
npx
wrangler
dev
This command starts a local server and simulates the Cloudflare Workers environment. You can visit the printed URL in your browser to test the worker application. It should return a JSON response with the list of books from the
books_to_read
table.
Setting up Cloudflare Hyperdrive
With our Workers application able to query the Neon database, we will now set up Cloudflare Hyperdrive to connect to Neon and accelerate the database queries.
Create a new Hyperdrive service
You can use the
Wrangler
CLI to create a new Hyperdrive service, using your Neon database connection string from earlier:
npx
wrangler
hyperdrive
create
neon-guide-drive
--connection-string=$NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
This command creates a new Hyperdrive service named
neon-guide-drive
and outputs its configuration details. Copy the
id
field from the output, which we will use next.
Bind the Worker project to Hyperdrive
Cloudflare workers uses
Bindings
to interact with other resources on the Cloudflare platform. We will update the
wrangler.toml
file in the project directory to bind our Worker project to the Hyperdrive service.
Add the following lines to the
wrangler.toml
file. This lets us access the Hyperdrive service from our Worker application using the
HYPERDRIVE
binding.
[[hyperdrive]]
binding
=
"HYPERDRIVE"
id
=
$id-from-previous-step
Update the Worker script to use Hyperdrive
Now, you can update the
src/index.js
file in the project directory to query the Neon database, through the Hyperdrive service.
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
postgres
from
'postgres'
;
export
default
{
async
fetch
(request
,
env
,
ctx) {
const
sql
=
postgres
(
env
.
HYPERDRIVE
.connectionString);
const
rows
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM books_to_read`
;
return
new
Response
(
JSON
.stringify
(rows));
}
,
};
Deploy the updated Worker
Now that we have updated the Worker script to use the Hyperdrive service, we can deploy the updated Worker to the Cloudflare Workers platform:
npx
wrangler
deploy
This command uploads the updated Worker script to the Cloudflare Workers platform and makes it available at a public URL. You can visit the URL in your browser to test that the application works.
Removing the example application and Neon project
To delete your Worker project, you can use the Cloudflare dashboard or run
wrangler delete
from your project directory, specifying your project name. Refer to the
Wrangler documentation
for more details.
To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under
Delete a project
.
Example application
Neon + Cloudflare Hyperdrive
Demonstrates using Cloudflare's Hyperdrive to access your Neon database from Cloudflare Workers
Why sslmode=disable appears in Hyperdrive URLs
If you're using
Postgres.js
(or another library that requires SSL) with Neon and Hyperdrive, you might see an error like:
PostgresError: connection is insecure (try using sslmode=require)
This happens because the local connection string generated by Hyperdrive includes
sslmode=disable
. While this may look insecure, it's by design and your database connection is still secure:
Hyperdrive terminates SSL inside Cloudflare’s infrastructure.
Your Worker connects to Hyperdrive over an internal
.hyperdrive.local
address—no SSL needed.
Hyperdrive then connects to your Neon database using the original connection string with
sslmode=require
, maintaining full SSL encryption upstream.
Connection path:
Worker → Hyperdrive (.hyperdrive.local, no SSL)
Hyperdrive → Neon Database (SSL enabled)
This setup works in production. But for local development, libraries like Postgres.js may still reject the connection due to the local
sslmode=disable
.
✅
To avoid this issue locally
, use
wrangler dev --remote
. This runs your Worker in Cloudflare’s infrastructure, where the connection string works as expected.

Use Neon with Cloudflare Pages
Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Cloudflare Pages web application
Cloudflare Pages
is a modern web application hosting platform that allows you to build, deploy, and scale your web applications. While it is typically used to host static websites, you can also use it to host interactive web applications by leveraging
functions
to run server-side code. Internally, Cloudflare functions are powered by
Cloudflare Workers
, a serverless platform that allows you to run JavaScript code on Cloudflare's edge network.
This guide demonstrates how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from your Cloudflare Pages application. We'll create a simple web application using
React
that tracks our reading list using the database and provides a form to add new books to it.
We'll use the
Neon serverless driver
to connect to the database and make queries.

The
App
component fetches the list of books from the server and displays them. It also provides a form to add new books to the list.
Cloudflare
Pages allows us to define the API endpoints as serverless functions, which we'll implement next.
Implement the serverless functions
We'll use the
Neon serverless driver
to connect to the Neon database, so we first need to install it as a dependency:
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Next, we'll create two serverless functions for the application. In a
Cloudflare Pages
project, these must be defined in the
functions
directory at the root of the project. For further details, refer to the
Cloudflare Pages - Functions documentation
.
Function to fetch list of books from the database

This function extracts the book details from the request body and inserts it into the
books_to_read
table in the database. It returns a JSON response indicating the success or failure of the operation.
Test the application locally
Our application is now ready to be tested locally. However, we first need to configure the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to point to our Neon database.
We can do this by creating a
.dev.vars
file at the root of the project directory with the following content:
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
Now, to test the
Pages
application locally, we can use the
wrangler
CLI tool used to manage Cloudflare projects. We can use it using the
npx
command as:
npx
wrangler
pages
dev
--
npm
run
dev
This command starts a local server simulating the Cloudflare environment. The function endpoints are run by the Wrangler tool while requests to the root URL are proxied to the Vite development server.

File storage with Cloudflare R2
Store files via Cloudflare R2 and track metadata in Neon
Cloudflare R2
is S3-compatible object storage offering zero egress fees, designed for storing and serving large amounts of unstructured data like images, videos, and documents globally.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate Cloudflare R2 with Neon by storing file metadata in your Neon database, while using R2 for file storage.
Setup steps
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create a Cloudflare account and R2 bucket
Sign up for or log in to your
Cloudflare account
.
Navigate to
R2
in the Cloudflare dashboard sidebar.
Click
Create bucket
, provide a unique bucket name (e.g.,
my-neon-app-files
), and click
Create bucket
.
Generate R2 API credentials (
Access Key ID
and
Secret Access Key
) by following
Create an R2 API Token
. Select
Object Read & Write
permissions. Copy these credentials securely.
Obtain your Cloudflare
Account ID
by following
Find your Account ID
.
For this example, enable public access to your bucket URL by following
Allow public access to your bucket
. Note your bucket's public URL (e.g.,
https://pub-xxxxxxxx.r2.dev
).
Public access
Public access makes all objects readable via URL; consider private buckets and signed URLs for sensitive data in production.
Configure CORS for client-side uploads
If your application involves uploading files
directly from a web browser
using the generated presigned URLs, you must configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your R2 bucket. CORS rules tell R2 which web domains are allowed to make requests (like
PUT
requests for uploads) to your bucket. Without proper CORS rules, browser security restrictions will block these direct uploads.
Follow Cloudflare's guide to
Configure CORS
for your bucket. You can add rules via R2 Bucket settings in the Cloudflare dashboard.
Here’s an example CORS configuration allowing
PUT
uploads and
GET
requests from your deployed frontend application and your local development environment:
[
{
"AllowedOrigins"
:
[
"https://your-production-app.com"
,
// Replace with your actual frontend domain
"http://localhost:3000"
// For local development
]
,
"AllowedMethods"
:
[
"PUT"
,
"GET"
]
}
]
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need a table in Neon to store metadata about the objects uploaded to R2.
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a client like
psql
. Here is an example SQL statement to create a simple table including the object key, URL, user ID, and timestamp:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
r2_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
object_key
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
-- Key (path/filename) in R2
file_url
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- Publicly accessible URL
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Run the SQL statement. You can add other relevant columns (file size, content type, etc.) depending on your application needs.
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, remember to apply appropriate access policies to the
r2_files
table. This controls who can view or modify the object references stored in Neon based on your RLS rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata in Neon. Access control for the objects within the R2 bucket itself is managed via R2 permissions, API tokens, and presigned URL settings if used.
Upload files to R2 and store metadata in Neon
A common pattern with S3-compatible storage like R2 involves
presigned upload URLs
. Your backend generates a temporary, secure URL that the client uses to upload the file directly to R2. Afterwards, your backend saves the file's metadata to Neon.
This requires two backend endpoints:
/presign-upload
: Generates the temporary presigned URL for the client to upload a file directly to R2.
/save-metadata
: Records the metadata in Neon after the client confirms a successful upload to R2.
JavaScript
Python
We'll use
Hono
for the server,
@aws-sdk/client-s3
and
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
for R2 interaction, and
@neondatabase/serverless
for Neon.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install
@aws-sdk/client-s3
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner
@neondatabase/serverless
@hono/node-server
hono
dotenv
Create a
.env
file:
# R2 Credentials & Config
R2_ACCOUNT_ID
=
your_cloudflare_account_id
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
=
your_r2_api_token_access_key_id
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
=
your_r2_api_token_secret_access_key
R2_BUCKET_NAME
=
your_r2_bucket_name
# my-neon-app-files if following the example
R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL
=
https://your-bucket-public-url.r2.dev
# Your R2 bucket public URL
# Neon Connection String
DATABASE_URL
=
your_neon_database_connection_string

Explanation
Setup:
Initializes the Neon database client (
sql
), the Hono web framework (
app
), and the AWS S3 client (
s3
) configured for R2 using environment variables.
Authentication:
A placeholder
authMiddleware
is included.
Crucially
, this needs to be replaced with real authentication logic. It currently just sets a static
userId
for demonstration.
Upload endpoints
:
/presign-upload
:
Generates a temporary secure URL (
presignedUrl
) that allows uploading a file with a specific
objectKey
and
contentType
directly to R2 using
@aws-sdk/client-s3
. It returns the URL, key, and public URL.
/save-metadata
:
Called by the client
after
it successfully uploads the file to R2. It saves the
objectKey
, the final
file_url
, and the
userId
into the
r2_files
table in Neon using
@neondatabase/serverless
.
Testing the upload workflow
Testing the presigned URL flow involves multiple steps:
Get presigned URL:
Send a
POST
request to your
/presign-upload
endpoint with a JSON body containing
fileName
and
contentType
.
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/presign-upload
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"fileName": "test-image.png", "contentType": "image/png"}'
You should receive a JSON response with a
presignedUrl
,
objectKey
, and
publicFileUrl
:
{
"success"
:
true
,
"presignedUrl"
:
"https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<BUCKET_NAME>/<GENERATED_OBJECT_KEY>?X-Amz-Algorithm=..."
,
"objectKey"
:
"<GENERATED_OBJECT_KEY>"
,
"publicFileUrl"
:
"https://pub-<HASH>.r2.dev/<GENERATED_OBJECT_KEY>"
}
Note the
presignedUrl
,
objectKey
, and
publicFileUrl
from the response. You will use these in the next steps.
Upload file to R2:
Use the received
presignedUrl
to upload the actual file using an HTTP
PUT
request.
curl
-X
PUT
"<PRESIGNED_URL>"
\
--upload-file
/path/to/your/test-image.png
\
-H
"Content-Type: image/png"
A successful upload typically returns HTTP
200 OK
with no body.
Save metadata:
Send a
POST
request to your
/save-metadata
endpoint with the
objectKey
and
publicFileUrl
obtained in step 1.
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/save-metadata
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{"objectKey": "<OBJECT_KEY>", "publicFileUrl": "<PUBLIC_URL>"}'
You should receive a JSON response indicating success:
{
"success"
:
true
}
Expected outcome:
The file is uploaded to your R2 bucket. You can verify this in the Cloudflare dashboard or by accessing the
publicFileUrl
if your bucket is public.
A new row appears in your
r2_files
table in Neon containing the
object_key
and
file_url
.
You can now integrate API calls to these endpoints from various parts of your application (e.g., web clients using JavaScript's
fetch
API, mobile apps, backend services) to handle file uploads.
Accessing file metadata and files
Storing metadata in Neon allows your application to easily retrieve references to the files hosted on R2.
Query the
r2_files
table from your application's backend when needed.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve files for user 'user_123':
SELECT
id,
-- Your database primary key
object_key,
-- Key (path/filename) in the R2 bucket
file_url,
-- Publicly accessible URL
user_id,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
FROM
r2_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
;
-- Use actual authenticated user ID
Using the data:
The query returns rows containing the file metadata stored in Neon.
The
file_url
column contains the direct link to access the file.
Use this
file_url
in your application (e.g.,
<img>
tags, API responses, download links) wherever you need to display or provide access to the file.
Private buckets
For private R2 buckets, store only the
object_key
and generate presigned
read
URLs on demand using a similar backend process.
This pattern separates file storage and delivery (handled by R2) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon).

Media storage with Cloudinary
Store files via Cloudinary and track metadata in Neon
Cloudinary
is a cloud-based platform for image and video management, offering upload, storage, real-time manipulation, optimization, and delivery via CDN.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate Cloudinary with Neon. You'll learn how to securely upload files directly from the client-side to Cloudinary using signatures generated by your backend, and then store the resulting asset metadata (like the Cloudinary Public ID and secure URL) in your Neon database.
Setup steps
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create a Cloudinary account and get credentials
Sign up for a free or paid account at
Cloudinary.com
.
Once logged in, navigate to your
Account settings
.
Find your
Product Environment Credentials
which include:
Cloud Name
API Key
API Secret
Create a new
API Key
if you do not have one. This key is used to authenticate your application with Cloudinary.
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need a table in Neon to store metadata about the assets uploaded to Cloudinary.
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a client like
psql
. Create a table to store relevant details:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
cloudinary_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
public_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
-- Cloudinary's unique identifier for the asset
media_url
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- Media URL for the asset on Cloudinary's CDN
resource_type
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- Type of asset (e.g., 'image', 'video', 'raw')
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Run the SQL statement. You can customize this table by adding other useful columns returned by Cloudinary (e.g.,
version
,
format
,
width
,
height
,
tags
).
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, apply appropriate policies to the
cloudinary_files
table to control access to the metadata stored in Neon based on your rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata in Neon. Access control for the assets themselves is managed within Cloudinary (e.g., via asset types, delivery types). By default, uploaded assets are typically accessible via their CDN URL.
Upload files to Cloudinary and store metadata in Neon
The recommended secure approach for client-side uploads to Cloudinary involves
signed uploads
. Your backend generates a unique signature using your API Secret and specific upload parameters (like timestamp). The client uses this signature, along with your API Key and the parameters, to authenticate the direct upload request to Cloudinary. After a successful upload, the client sends the returned asset metadata back to your backend to save in Neon.
This requires two backend endpoints:
/generate-signature
: Generates a signature, timestamp, and provides the API key for the client upload.
/save-metadata
: Receives asset metadata from the client after a successful Cloudinary upload and saves it to the Neon database.
JavaScript
Python
We'll use
Hono
for the server, the official
cloudinary
Node.js SDK for signature generation, and
@neondatabase/serverless
for Neon.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install
cloudinary
@neondatabase/serverless
@hono/node-server
hono
dotenv
Create a
.env
file with your credentials:
# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
=
your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
=
your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
=
your_cloudinary_api_secret
# Neon Connection String
DATABASE_URL
=
your_neon_database_connection_string

Explanation
Setup:
Initializes the Neon client (
sql
), Hono (
app
), and configures the Cloudinary Node.js SDK using environment variables.
Authentication:
Includes a placeholder
authMiddleware
.
Replace this with your actual user authentication logic.
API endpoints:
/generate-signature
(GET):
Creates a current
timestamp
. Uses
cloudinary.utils.api_sign_request
with the parameters to sign (at minimum, the timestamp) and your
API Secret
to generate a
signature
. It returns the
signature
,
timestamp
, and your
API Key
to the client. These are needed for the client's direct upload request to Cloudinary.
/save-metadata
(POST):
Called by the client
after
a successful direct upload to Cloudinary. The client sends the relevant asset metadata received from Cloudinary (
public_id
,
secure_url
,
resource_type
). The endpoint saves this information, along with the
userId
, into the
cloudinary_files
table in Neon.
Testing the upload workflow
This workflow involves getting a signature from your backend, using it to upload directly to Cloudinary, and then notifying your backend.
Get signature and parameters:
Send a
GET
request to your backend's
/generate-signature
endpoint.
curl
-X
GET
http://localhost:3000/generate-signature
Expected response:
A JSON object with the
signature
,
timestamp
, and
api_key
.
{
"success"
:
true
,
"signature"
:
"a1b2c3d4e5f6..."
,
"timestamp"
:
1713999600
,
"api_key"
:
"YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"
}
Upload file directly to Cloudinary:
Use the obtained
signature
,
timestamp
,
api_key
, and the file path to send a
POST
request with
multipart/form-data
directly to the Cloudinary Upload API. The URL includes your
Cloud Name
.
curl
-X
POST
https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/
<
YOUR_CLOUD_NAM
E
>
/image/upload
\
-F
"file=@/path/to/your/test-image.jpg"
\
-F
"api_key=<API_KEY_FROM_STEP_1>"
\
-F
"timestamp=<TIMESTAMP_FROM_STEP_1>"
\
-F
"signature=<SIGNATURE_FROM_STEP_1>"
If uploading a video, change the endpoint in the URL from
/image/upload
to
/video/upload
.
Expected response (from Cloudinary):
A successful upload returns a JSON object with metadata about the uploaded asset.
{
"asset_id"
:
"..."
,
"public_id"
:
"<PUBLIC_ID>"
,
"version"
:
1713999601
,
"version_id"
:
"..."
,
"signature"
:
"..."
,
"width"
:
800
,
"height"
:
600
,
"format"
:
"jpg"
,
"resource_type"
:
"image"
,
"created_at"
:
"2025-04-24T05:37:06Z"
,
"tags"
:
[]
,
"bytes"
:

,
"secure_url"
:
"https://res.cloudinary.com/<YOUR_CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload/v1713999601/sample_image_123.jpg"
,
"folder"
:
""
,
"original_filename"
:
"test-image"
,
"api_key"
:
"YOUR_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"
}
Note the
public_id
,
secure_url
, and
resource_type
in the response. These are needed for the next step.
Save metadata:
Send a
POST
request to your backend's
/save-metadata
endpoint with the key details received from Cloudinary in Step 2.
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/save-metadata
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{
"public_id": "<PUBLIC_ID_FROM_STEP_2>",
"secure_url": "<SECURE_URL_FROM_STEP_2>",
"resource_type": "<RESOURCE_TYPE_FROM_STEP_2>"
}'
Expected response (from your backend):
{
"success"
:
true
}
Expected outcome:
The file is successfully uploaded to your Cloudinary account (visible in the Media Library).
A new row corresponding to the uploaded asset exists in your
cloudinary_files
table in Neon.
Accessing file metadata and files
With metadata stored in Neon, your application can retrieve references to the media hosted on Cloudinary.
Query the
cloudinary_files
table from your application's backend whenever you need to display or link to uploaded files.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve media files associated with a specific user:
SELECT
id,
public_id,
-- Cloudinary Public ID
media_url,
-- HTTPS URL for the asset
resource_type,
user_id,
upload_timestamp
FROM
cloudinary_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
AND
resource_type
=
'image'
;
-- Use actual user ID & desired type
Using the data:
The query returns metadata stored in Neon.
The
media_url
is the direct CDN link to the asset.
Cloudinary transformations:
Cloudinary excels at on-the-fly transformations. You can manipulate the asset by modifying the
media_url
. Parameters are inserted between the
/upload/
part and the version/public_id part of the URL. For example, to get a 300px wide, cropped version:
https://res.cloudinary.com/<CLOUD_NAME>/image/upload/w_300,c_fill/v<VERSION>/<PUBLIC_ID>.<FORMAT>
. Explore the extensive
Cloudinary transformation documentation
.
This pattern separates media storage, processing, and delivery (handled by Cloudinary) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon).

Datadog API and Application Keys
Identify Datadog site
Available for Scale and Business Plan users, the Neon Datadog integration lets you monitor Neon database performance, resource utilization, and system health directly from Datadog's observability platform.
How it works
The integration enables secure, reliable export of Neon metrics and Postgres logs to Datadog. By configuring the integration with your Datadog API key, Neon automatically sends data from your project to your selected Datadog site.
note
Data is sent for all computes in your Neon project. For example, if you have multiple branches, each with an attached compute, both metrics and logs will be collected and sent for each compute.
Neon metrics
The integration exports
a comprehensive set of metrics
including:
Connection counts
— Tracks active and idle database connections.
Database size
— Monitors total size of all databases in bytes.
Replication delay
— Measures replication lag in bytes and seconds.
Compute metrics
— Includes CPU and memory usage statistics for your compute.
Postgres logs
Beta
Postgres logs export
is in beta and ready to use. We're actively improving it based on feedback from developers like you. Share your experience in our
Discord
or via the
Neon Console
.
The Neon Datadog integration can forward Postgres logs to your Datadog account. These logs provide visibility into database activity, errors, and performance. See
Export Postgres logs to Datadog
for details.
Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure the following:
You have a Neon account and project. If not, see
Sign up for a Neon account
.
You have a Datadog account and API key.
You know the region you selected for your Datadog account. Here's how to check:
Find your Datadog region
Steps to integrate Datadog with Neon
In the Neon Console, navigate to the
Integrations
page in your Neon project.
Locate the
Datadog
card and click
Add
.
Enter your
Datadog API key
. You can generate or retrieve
Datadog API Keys
from your Datadog organization. For instructions, see
Datadog API and Application Keys
.
Select the Datadog
site
that you used when setting up your Datadog account.
Select what you want to export. You can enable either or both:
Metrics
: System metrics and database statistics (CPU, memory, connections, etc.)
Postgres logs
: Error messages, warnings, connection events, and system notifications
Click
Confirm
to complete the integration.
note
You can change these settings later by editing your integration configuration.
Optionally, you can import the Neon-provided JSON configuration file into Datadog, which creates a pre-built dashboard from
Neon metrics
, similar to the charts available on our Monitoring page. See
Import Neon dashboard
.
We do not yet provide a pre-built dashboard for
Postgres logs
, but it's coming soon.
Once the integration is set up, Neon will start sending Neon metrics to Datadog, and you can use these metrics to create custom dashboards and alerts in Datadog.
note
Neon computes only send logs and metrics when they are active. If the
Scale to Zero
feature is enabled and a compute is suspended due to inactivity, no logs or metrics will be sent during the suspension. This may result in gaps in your Neon logs and metrics in Datadog. If you notice missing data in Datadog, check if your compute is suspended. You can verify a compute's status as
Idle
or
Active
on the
Branches
page in the Neon console, and review
Suspend compute
events on the
System operations
tab of the
Monitoring
page.
Additionally, if you are setting up Neon's Datadog integration for a project with an inactive compute, you'll need to activate the compute before it can send metrics and logs to Datadog. To activate it, simply run a query from the
Neon SQL Editor
or any connected client on the branch associated with the compute.
Example usage in Datadog
Once integrated, you can create custom dashboards in Datadog by querying the metrics sent from Neon. Use Datadog's
Metrics Explorer
to search for metrics like
neon_connection_counts
,
neon_db_total_size
, and
host_cpu_seconds_total
. You can also set alerts based on threshold values for critical metrics.
Import the Neon dashboard
As part of the integration, Neon provides a JSON configuration file that you can import into Datadog to start with a pre-built dashboard based on a subset of Neon metrics.
Here's how you can import the dashboard:
In the Neon Console, open your Datadog integration from the
Integrations
page.
Scroll to the bottom of the panel and copy the JSON from there.
OR
You can copy the
JSON below
instead.
Next, create a new dashboard in Datadog.
Open
Configure
, select
Import dashboard JSON
, then paste the Neon-provided configuration JSON.
If any of the computes in your project are active, you should start seeing data in the resulting charts right away. By default, the charts show metrics for all active endpoints in your project. You can filter results to one or more selected endpoints using the
endpoint_id
variable dropdown selector.

Available metrics
Neon makes the following metrics available for export to third parties; for now, availability is limited to the Datadog integration but will soon be expanded to other providers.
All metrics include the following labels:
project_id
endpoint_id
compute_id
job
Here's an example of the metric
db_total_size
with all labels:
neon_db_total_size{project_id=
"square-daffodil-12345678"
, endpoint_id=
"ep-aged-art-260862"
, compute_id=
"compute-shrill-blaze-b4hry7fg"
, job=
"sql-metrics"
}
10485760
note
In Datadog, metric labels are referred to as
tags.
See
Getting Started with Tags
in the Datadog Docs.
Name
Job
Description
neon_connection_counts
sql-metrics
Total number of database connections. The
state
label indicates whether the connection is
active
(executing queries),
idle
(awaiting queries), or in a variety of other states derived from the
pg_stat_activity
Postgres view.
neon_db_total_size
sql-metrics
Total size of all databases in your project, measured in bytes.
neon_lfc_approximate_working_set_size_windows
sql-metrics
Approximate
working set size
in pages of 8192 bytes. The metric is tracked over time windows (5m, 15m, 1h) to gauge access patterns. Duration values:
duration="5m"
,
duration="15m"
,
duration="1h"
.
neon_lfc_cache_size_limit
sql-metrics
The limit on the size of the Local File Cache (LFC), measured in bytes.
neon_lfc_hits
sql-metrics
The number of times requested data was found in the LFC (cache hit). Higher cache hit rates indicate efficient memory use.
neon_lfc_misses
sql-metrics
The number of times requested data was not found in the LFC (cache miss), forcing a read from slower storage. High miss rates may indicate insufficient compute size.
neon_lfc_used
sql-metrics
The amount of space currently used in the LFC, measured in 1MB chunks. It reflects how much of the cache limit is being utilized.
neon_lfc_writes
sql-metrics
The number of write operations to the LFC.
neon_max_cluster_size
sql-metrics
The
neon.max_cluster_size
setting in MB.
neon_pg_stats_userdb
sql-metrics
Aggregated metrics from the
pg_stat_database
Postgres view.
We collect stats from the oldest non-system databases based on their creation time, but not for all databases. Only the first X databases (sorted by creation time) are included.
datname
: The name of the database
kind
: The type of value being reported. One of the following:
db_size
: The size of the database on disk, in bytes (pg_database_size(datname))
deadlocks
: The number of deadlocks detected
inserted
: The number of rows inserted (tup_inserted)

compute-host-metrics
The number of CPU seconds accumulated in different operating modes (user, system, idle, etc.).
host_load1
compute-host-metrics
System load averaged over the last 1 minute. Example: for 0.25 vCPU,
host_load1
of
0.25
means full utilization, >0.25 indicates waiting processes.
host_load5
compute-host-metrics
System load averaged over the last 5 minutes.

Export Postgres logs to Datadog
You can export your Postgres logs from your Neon compute to your Datadog account. These logs provide visibility into database activity and system events that Postgres generates, such as:
Error messages and warnings
Connection events
System notifications
Logs in Datadog include the following labels and metadata for filtering and organization:
project_id
endpoint_id
Timestamp
Log level
And other standard PostgreSQL log fields
note
During the beta phase, you may see some Neon-specific system logs included. These will be filtered out before general availability (GA).
Performance impact
Enabling this feature may result in:
An increase in compute resource usage for log processing
Additional network egress for log transmission (Neon does not charge for data transfer on paid plans)
Associated costs based on log volume in Datadog
note
Neon computes only send logs when they are active. If the
Scale to Zero
feature is enabled and a compute is suspended due to inactivity, no logs will be sent during the suspension.
Technical details
Neon processes logs directly on each compute instance using
rsyslogd
, an industry-standard open source logging utility. This compute-level processing means that log collection contributes to your compute's resource usage.
Feedback and future improvements
We’re always looking to improve! If you have feature requests or feedback, please let us know via the
Feedback form
in the Neon Console or on our
Discord channel
.
Need help?
Join our
Discord Server
to ask questions or see what others are doing with Neon. Users on paid plans can open a support ticket from the console. For more details, see

Use Neon with Deno Deploy
Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Deno Deploy application
Deno Deploy
is a scalable serverless platform for running JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, designed by the creators of Deno. It simplifies the deployment process and offers automatic scaling, zero-downtime deployments, and global distribution.
This guide demonstrates how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from a simple Deno application using the
Neon serverless driver
on
JSR
.
The guide covers two deployment options:
Deploying your application locally with Deno Runtime
Deploying your application with the Deno Deploy serverless platform
Prerequisites
To follow the instructions in this guide, you will need:
A Neon project. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
To use the Deno Deploy serverless platform, you require a Deno Deploy account. Visit
Deno Deploy
to sign up or log in.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Your connection string should look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode
=require
You'll need the connection string a little later in the setup.
Deploy your application locally with Deno Runtime
Deno Runtime is an open-source runtime for TypeScript and JavaScript. The following instructions describe how to deploy an example application locally using Deno Runtime.
Install the Deno Runtime and deployctl
Follow the
Install Deno and deployctl
instructions in the Deno documentation to install the Deno runtime and
deployctl
command-line utility on your local machine.
Set up the Neon serverless driver
First, install the Neon serverless driver using the
deno add
command:
deno
add
jsr:@neon/serverless
note
You can also use npm to install the Neon serverless driver
npx
jsr
add
@neon/serverless
This will create or update your
deno.json
file with the necessary dependency:
{
"imports"
:
{
"@neon/serverless"
:
"jsr:@neon/serverless@^0.10.1"
}
}
Create the example application
Next, create the
server.ts
script on your local machine.
// server.ts
import
{ neon }
from
'@neon/serverless'
;
const
databaseUrl
=
Deno
.
env
.get
(
'DATABASE_URL'
)
!
;
const
sql
=
neon
(databaseUrl);
// Create the books table and insert initial data if it doesn't exist
await
sql
`
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
title TEXT NOT NULL,
author TEXT NOT NULL
)
`
;
// Check if the table is empty
const
{
count
}
=
await
sql
`SELECT COUNT(*)::INT as count FROM books`
.then
((rows)
=>
rows[
0
]);
if
(count
===
0
) {
// The table is empty, insert the book records
await
sql
`
INSERT INTO books (title, author) VALUES
('The Hobbit', 'J. R. R. Tolkien'),
('Harry Potter and the Philosopher''s Stone', 'J. K. Rowling'),
('The Little Prince', 'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry')
`
;
}
// Start the server
Deno
.serve
(
async
(req)
=>
{
const
url
=
new
URL
(
req
.url);
if
(
url
.pathname
!==
'/books'
) {
return
new
Response
(
'Not Found'
,
{ status
:
404
});
}
try
{
switch
(
req
.method) {
case
'GET'
: {
const
books
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM books`
;
return
new
Response
(
JSON
.stringify
(books
,
null
,
2
)
,
{
headers
:
{
'content-type'
:
'application/json'
}
,
});
}
default
:
return
new
Response
(
'Method Not Allowed'
,
{ status
:
405
});
}
}
catch
(err) {
console
.error
(err);
return
new
Response
(
`Internal Server Error\n\n
${
err
.message
}
`
,
{
status
:
500
,
});
}
});
The script creates a table named
books
in the
neondb
database if it does not exist and inserts some data into it. It then starts a server that listens for requests on the
/books
endpoint. When a request is received, the script returns data from the
books
table.
Run the script locally
To run the script locally, set the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to the Neon connection string you copied earlier.
export
DATABASE_URL
=
YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
Then, run the command below to start the app server. The
--allow-env
flag allows the script to access the environment variables, and the
--allow-net
flag allows the script to make network requests. If the Deno runtime prompts you to allow these permissions, enter
y
to continue.
deno
run
--allow-env
--allow-net
server.ts
Query the endpoint
You can request the
/books
endpoint with a
cURL
command to view the data returned by the script:
curl
http://localhost:8000/books
The
cURL
command should return the following data:
[
{
"id"
:
1
,
"title"
:
"The Hobbit"
,
"author"
:
"J. R. R. Tolkien"
}
,
{
"id"
:
2
,
"title"
:
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"
,
"author"
:
"J. K. Rowling"
}
,
{
"id"
:
3
,
"title"
:
"The Little Prince"
,
"author"
:
"Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"
}
]
Deploy your application with Deno Deploy
Deno Deploy is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript applications. Your code runs on managed servers geographically close to your users, enabling low latency and faster response times. Deno Deploy applications run on light-weight V8 isolates powered by the Deno runtime.

If you have not done so already, install the
deployctl
command-line utility, as described
above
.
If you have not done so already, create the example
server.ts
application on your local machine, as described
above
.
Register or log in to
Deno
and navigate to the
Create a project
page, where you can select a project template for your preferred framework, link a code repo, or create an empty project.
The example application in this guide is a simple Deno script you've created locally, so let's select the
Create an empty project
option. Note the name of your Deno Deploy project. You will need it in a later step. Projects are given a generated Heroku-style name, which looks something like this:
cloudy-otter-57
.
Click the
Settings
button and add a
DATABASE_URL
environment variable. Set the value to your Neon connection string and click
Save
.
To authenticate
deployctl
from the terminal, you will need an access token for your Deno Deploy account. Navigate back to your
Deno dashboard
and create a new access token. Copy the token value and set the
DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN
environment variable on your local machine by running this command from your terminal:
export
DENO_DEPLOY_TOKEN
=
YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Deploy using deployctl
To deploy the application, navigate to the directory of your
server.ts
application, and run the following command:
deployctl
deploy
--project=YOUR_DENO_DEPLOY_PROJECT_NAME
--prod
server.ts
The
--prod
flag specifies that the application should be deployed to the production environment.
The
deployctl
command deploys the application to the Deno Deploy serverless platform. Once the deployment is complete, you'll see a message similar to the following:
$
deployctl
deploy
--project=cloudy-otter-57
--prod
server.ts

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Django
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Django project
Django
is a high-level Python framework to make database-driven web applications. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer that abstracts database operations, making it easy to interact with databases using Python code. Django also includes a powerful migration system that allows you to define and manage database schema changes over time.
This guide demonstrates how to use Django with a Neon Postgres database. We'll create a simple Django application and walk through the process of setting up the database, defining models, and generating and running migrations to manage schema changes.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
Python
installed on your local machine. We recommend using a newer version of Python, 3.8 or higher.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select a project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings, which you can find by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can be prone to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Setting up the Django project
Set up the Python environment
To manage our Django project dependencies, we create a new Python virtual environment. Run the following commands in your terminal to set it up.
python
-m
venv
myenv
Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
# On macOS and Linux
source
myenv/bin/activate
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
With the virtual environment activated, we can create a new directory for our Django project and install the required packages:
mkdir
guide-neon-django
&&
cd
guide-neon-django
pip
install
Django
"psycopg2-binary"
pip
install
python-dotenv
dj-database-url
pip
freeze
>
requirements.txt
We installed Django and the
psycopg2-binary
package to connect to the Neon Postgres database. We also added the
python-dotenv
to read environment variables easily, and the
dj-database-url
package to parse the Neon connection string into Django settings. We also saved the installed packages to a
requirements.txt
file so the project can be easily recreated in another environment.
Create a new Django project
Run the following command to create a new Django project in the current directory:
django-admin
startproject
guide_neon_django
.
This command creates a new Django project named
guide_neon_django
in the current directory.
Set up the Database configuration
Create a
.env
file in the project root directory and add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to it. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon Console earlier.
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
For Django to read the environment variables from the
.env
file, open the
settings.py
file located in the
guide_neon_django
directory and add the following code, updating the
DATABASES
setting:
# settings.py
import
os
import
dotenv
import
dj_database_url
dotenv
.
load_dotenv
(
"../.env"
)
DATABASES
=
{
"default"
:
dj_database_url
.
parse
(
url
=
os.
getenv
(
"DATABASE_URL"
,
""
),
conn_max_age
=
600
, conn_health_checks
=
True
)
}
Create a new Django app
Inside your project directory, run the following command to create a new Django app:
python
manage.py
startapp
catalog
This command creates a new app named
catalog
inside the Django project.
Defining data models and running migrations
Specify the data model
Now, open the
models.py
file in your
catalog
app directory and define the database models for your application:
# catalog/models.py
from
django
.
db
import
models
class
Author
(
models
.
Model
):
name
=
models
.
CharField
(max_length
=
100
)
bio
=
models
.
TextField
(blank
=
True
)
created_at
=
models
.
DateTimeField
(auto_now_add
=
True
)
def
__str__
(
self
):
return
self
.
name
class
Book
(
models
.
Model
):
title
=
models
.
CharField
(max_length
=
200
)
author
=
models
.
ForeignKey
(Author, on_delete
=
models.CASCADE)
created_at
=
models
.
DateTimeField
(auto_now_add
=
True
)
def
__str__
(
self
):
return
self
.
title
This code defines two models:
Author
and
Book
. The
Author
model represents an author with fields for
name
,
bio
, and a
created_at
timestamp. The
Book
model represents a book with fields for
title
,
author
(as a foreign key to the
Author
model), and a
created_at
timestamp. Django automatically creates an
id
field for each model as the primary key.
Generate migration files
We first add the new application
catalog
to the list of installed apps for the Django project. Open the
settings.py
file in the
guide_neon_django
directory and add the
catalog
app to the
INSTALLED_APPS
setting:
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS
=
[
"django.contrib.admin"
,
"django.contrib.auth"
,
"django.contrib.contenttypes"
,
"django.contrib.sessions"
,
"django.contrib.messages"
,
"django.contrib.staticfiles"
,
"catalog"
]
To generate migration files based on the defined models, run the following command:
python
manage.py
makemigrations
This command detects the new
Author
and
Book
models that were added and generates migration files in the
catalog/migrations
directory.
Apply the migration
Now, to apply the migration and create the corresponding tables in the Neon Postgres database, run the following command:
python
manage.py
migrate
This command executes the migration files and creates the necessary tables in the database. Note that Django creates multiple other tables, such as
django_migrations
and
auth_user
for its internal usage.
Seed the database
To populate the database with some initial data, we can create a custom management command for our app. Create a new file named
populate.py
in the
catalog/management/commands
directory.
mkdir
-p
catalog/management/commands
touch
catalog/management/commands/populate.py
Now, add the following code to the
populate.py
file to create some authors and books:
from
django
.
core
.
management
.
base
import
BaseCommand
from
catalog
.

))
Now, run the custom management command in your terminal and seed the database:
python
manage.py
populate
Implement the application
Create views to display data
We can now create views to display the authors and books in our application. Create a file
views.py
in the
catalog
app directory and add the following code:
# catalog/views.py
from
django
.
http
import
JsonResponse
from
django
.
core
import
serializers
from
.
models
import
Author
,
Book
def
list_authors
(
request
):
authors
=
Author
.
objects
.
all
()
data
=
[serializers
.
serialize
(
'json'
, authors)
]
return
JsonResponse
(data, safe
=
False
)
def
list_books_by_author
(
request
,
author_id
):
books
=
Book
.
objects
.
filter
(author_id
=
author_id)
data
=
[serializers
.
serialize
(
'json'
, books)
]
return
JsonResponse
(data, safe
=
False
)
We defined two views:
list_authors
to list all authors and
list_books_by_author
to list books by a specific author. The views return JSON responses with the serialized data.
Define URLs for the views
Next, create a file
urls.py
in the
catalog
app directory and add the following code:
# catalog/urls.py
from
django
.
urls
import
path
from
.
import
views
urlpatterns
=
[
path
(
'authors/'
, views.list_authors, name
=
'list_authors'
),
path
(
'books/<int:author_id>/'
, views.list_books_by_author, name
=
'list_books_by_author'
),
]
The URLs are mapped to the views defined previously using the Django URL dispatcher.
Include the app URLs in the project
Finally, include the
catalog
app URLs in the project's main
urls.py
file, by updating the urlpatterns list:
# guide_neon_django/urls.py
from
django
.
contrib
import
admin
from
django
.
urls
import
path
,
include
urlpatterns
=
[
path
(
'admin/'
, admin.site.urls),
path
(
'catalog/'
,
include
(
'catalog.urls'
)),
]
Run the Django development server
To start the Django development server and test the application, run the following command:
python
manage.py
runserver
Navigate to the url
http://localhost:8000/catalog/authors/
in your browser to view the list of authors. You can also view the books by a specific author by visiting
http://localhost:8000/catalog/books/<author_id>/
.
Applying schema changes
We will demonstrate how to handle schema changes by adding a new field
country
to the
Author
model, to store the author's country of origin.
Update the data model
Open the
models.py
file in your
catalog
app directory and add a new field to the
Author
model:
# catalog/models.py
class
Author
(
models
.
Model
):
name
=
models
.
CharField
(max_length
=
100
)
bio
=
models
.
TextField
(blank
=
True
)
country
=
models
.
CharField
(max_length
=
100
, blank
=
True
)
created_at
=
models
.
DateTimeField
(auto_now_add
=
True
)
def
__str__
(
self
):
return
self
.
name
Generate and run the migration
To generate a new migration file for the schema change, run the following command:
python
manage.py
makemigrations
This command detects the updated
Author
models and generates a new migration file to add the new field to the corresponding table in the database. Now, to apply the migration, run the following command:
python
manage.py
migrate
Test the schema change
Restart the Django development server.
python
manage.py
runserver
Navigate to the url
http://localhost:8000/catalog/authors
to view the list of authors. You should see the new
country
field included and set to empty for each author entry, reflecting the schema change.
Conclusion
In this guide, we demonstrated how to set up a Django project with Neon Postgres, define database models, and generate migrations and run them. Django's ORM and migration system make it easy to interact with the database and manage schema evolution over time.

Connect a Django application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Django application
To connect to Neon from a Django application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
To create a Neon project:
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Configure Django connection settings
Connecting to Neon requires configuring database connection settings in your Django project's
settings.py
file.
note
To avoid the
endpoint ID is not specified
connection issue described
here
, be sure that you are using an up-to-date driver.
In your Django project, navigate to the
DATABASES
section of your
settings.py
file and modify the connection details as shown:
# Add these at the top of your settings.py
from
os
import
getenv
from
dotenv
import
load_dotenv
# Replace the DATABASES section of your settings.py with this
DATABASES
=
{
'default'
:
{
'ENGINE'
:
'django.db.backends.postgresql'
,
'NAME'
:

},
'DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS'
:
True
,
}
}
note
Neon places computes into an idle state and closes connections after 5 minutes of inactivity (see
Compute lifecycle
). To avoid connection errors, you can set the Django
CONN_MAX_AGE
setting to 0 to close database connections at the end of each request so that your application does not attempt to reuse connections that were closed by Neon. From Django 4.1, you can use a higher
CONN_MAX_AGE
setting in combination with the
CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS
setting to enable connection reuse while preventing errors that might occur due to closed connections. For more information about these configuration options, see
Connection management
, in the
Django documentation
.
You can find all of the connection details listed above by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
For additional information about Django project settings, see
Django Settings: Databases
, in the Django documentation.
Connection issues
Django uses the
psycopg2
driver as the default adapter for Postgres. If you have an older version of that driver, you may encounter an
Endpoint ID is not specified
error when connecting to Neon. This error occurs if the client library used by your driver does not support the Server Name Indication (SNI) mechanism in TLS, which Neon uses to route incoming connections. The
psycopg2
driver uses the
libpq
client library, which supports SNI as of v14. You can check your
psycopg2
and
libpq
versions by starting a Django shell in your Django project and running the following commands:
# Start a Django shell
python3
manage.py
shell
# Check versions
import
psycopg2
print
(
"psycopg2 version:"
,
psycopg2.__version__
)
print
(
"libpq version:"
,
psycopg2._psycopg.libpq_version
())
The version number for
libpq
is presented in a different format, for example, version 14.1 will be shown as 140001. If your
libpq
version is less than version 14, you can either upgrade your
psycopg2
driver to get a newer
libpq
version or use one of the workarounds described in our
Connection errors
documentation. Upgrading your
psycopg2
driver may introduce compatibility issues with your Django or Python version, so you should test your application thoroughly.
If you encounter an
SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected
when connecting to the database, this typically occurs because the application is trying to reuse a connection after the Neon compute has been suspended due to inactivity. To resolve this issue, try one of the following options:
Set your Django
CONN_MAX_AGE
setting to a value less than or equal to the scale to zero setting configured for your compute. The default is 5 minutes (300 seconds).
Enable
CONN_HEALTH_CHECKS
by setting it to
true
. This forces a health check to verify that the connection is alive before executing a query.
For information configuring Neon's Scale to zero setting, see
Configuring Scale to zero for Neon computes

Connect a .NET (C#) application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a .NET (C#) application
This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from a .NET (C#) application. We'll build a simple book library that demonstrates basic database operations using the Npgsql provider.
note
The same configuration steps can be used for any .NET application type, including ASP.NET Core Web API, MVC, Blazor, or Windows Forms applications.
To connect to Neon from a .NET application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a .NET project and add dependencies
Create a new console application and change to the newly created directory:
dotnet
new
console
-n
NeonLibraryExample
cd
NeonLibraryExample
IMPORTANT
Ensure you install package versions that match your .NET version. You can verify your .NET version at any time by running
dotnet --version
.
Add the Npgsql NuGet package:
dotnet
add
package
Npgsql
--version
YOUR_DOTNET_VERSION
Store your Neon credentials
Create or update the
appsettings.json
file in the project directory with your Neon connection string:
{
"ConnectionStrings"
:
{
"DefaultConnection"
:
"Host=your-neon-host;Database=your-database;Username=your-username;Password=your-password;SSL Mode=Require;Trust Server Certificate=true"
}
}
Add the configuration package to read the settings:
dotnet
add
package
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json
--version
YOUR_DOTNET_VERSION
important
To ensure the security of your data, never commit your credentials to version control. Consider using user secrets or environment variables for development, and secure vault solutions for production.
Perform database operations
Create table
The following code gets the connection string from
appsettings.json
, establishes a connection to your Neon database, and creates a new table for storing books. We use the
NpgsqlConnection
to open a connection and then execute a
CREATE TABLE
statement using NpgsqlCommand's
ExecuteNonQuery()
method. The table includes columns for the book's ID (automatically generated), title, author, and publication year.

}
Add books
Next, we'll insert some books into our new table. We use an
INSERT
statement with parameters to safely add books to the database. The
ExecuteNonQuery()
method tells us how many books were added.

List books
To retrieve our books, we'll use a
SELECT
statement and read the results using a DataReader. The reader allows us to iterate through the results row by row, accessing each column value with the appropriate Get method based on its data type.
using
(
var
conn
=
new
NpgsqlConnection

);
}
}
}
Update books
To update books in our database, we use an
UPDATE
statement with parameters to ensure the operation is performed safely. The
ExecuteNonQuery()
method tells us how many books were updated.
using
(
var
conn
=
new
NpgsqlConnection

Remove books
To delete books from our database, we use a
DELETE
statement with parameters to ensure the operation is performed safely. The
ExecuteNonQuery()
method tells us how many books were deleted.

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Drizzle ORM
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your TypeScript project using Drizzle ORM
Drizzle
is a TypeScript-first ORM that connects to all major databases and works across most Javascript runtimes. It provides a simple way to define database schemas and queries in an SQL-like dialect and tools to generate and run migrations.
This guide shows how to use
Drizzle
with the
Neon
Postgres database in a Typescript project. We'll create a simple Node.js application with
Hono.js
and demonstrate the full workflow of setting up and working with your database using
Drizzle
.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select a project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings, which you can find by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can lead to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Setting up the TypeScript application
Create a new Hono.js project
We'll create a simple catalog, with API endpoints that query the database for authors and a list of their books. Run the following command in your terminal to set up a new project using
Hono.js
:
npm
create
hono@latest
neon-drizzle-guide
This initiates an interactive CLI prompt to set up a new project. To follow along with this guide, you can use the following settings:
Need
to
install
the
following
packages:
create-hono@0.9.0
Ok
to
proceed?
(y) y
create-hono
version
0.9.0
✔

install
project
dependencies?
…
yes
✔
Which
package
manager
do
you

›
npm
To use Drizzle and connect to the Neon database, we also add the
drizzle-orm
and
drizzle-kit
packages to our project, along with the
Neon serverless
driver library.
cd
neon-drizzle-guide
&&
touch
.env
npm
install
drizzle-orm
@neondatabase/serverless
npm
install
-D
drizzle-kit
dotenv
Add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to your
.env
file, which you'll use to connect to our Neon database. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon Console earlier:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
Test that the starter
Hono.js
application works by running
npm run dev
in the terminal. You should see the
Hello, Hono!
message when you navigate to
http://localhost:3000
in your browser.
Set up the database schema
Now, we will define the schema for the application using the
Drizzle
ORM. Create a new
schema.ts
file in your
src
directory and add the following code:
// src/schema.ts
import
{ pgTable
,
integer
,
serial
,
text
,
timestamp }
from
'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
;
export
const
authors
=
pgTable
(
'authors'
,
{
id
:
serial
(
'id'
)
.primaryKey
()
,
name
:
text
(
'name'
)
.notNull
()
,
bio
:
text
(
'bio'
)
,
createdAt
:
timestamp
(
'created_at'
)
.notNull
()
.defaultNow
()
,
});
export
const
books
=
pgTable
(
'books'
,
{
id
:
serial
(
'id'
)
.primaryKey
()
,
title
:
text
(
'title'
)
.notNull
()
,
authorId
:
integer
(
'author_id'
)
.references
(()
=>
authors
.id)
,
createdAt
:
timestamp
(
'created_at'
)
.notNull
()
.defaultNow
()
,
});
The code defines two tables:
authors
, which will contain the list of all the authors, and
books
, which will contain the list of books written by the authors. Each book is associated with an author using the
authorId
field.
To generate a migration to create these tables in the database, we'll use the
drizzle-kit
command. Add the following script to the
package.json
file at the root of your project:
{
"scripts"
:
{
"db:generate"
:
"drizzle-kit generate --dialect=postgresql --schema=src/schema.ts --out=./drizzle"
}
}
Then, run the following command in your terminal to generate the migration files:
npm
run
db:generate
This command generates a new folder named
drizzle
containing the migration files for the
authors
and
books
tables.
Run the migration
The generated migration file is written in SQL and contains the necessary commands to create the tables in the database. To apply these migrations, we'll use the
Neon serverless driver
and helper functions provided by the
drizzle-orm
library.
Create a new
migrate.ts
in your
src
directory and add the following code:
// src/migrate.ts
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
{ migrate }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http/migrator'
;
import
{ config }
from
'dotenv'
;
config
({ path
:
'.env'
});
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
!
);
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql);
const
main
=
async
()
=>
{
try
{
await
migrate
(db
,
{ migrationsFolder
:
'drizzle'
});
console
.log
(
'Migration completed'
);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Error during migration:'
,
error);
process
.exit
(
1
);
}
};
main
();
The
drizzle-orm
package comes with an integration for
Neon
, which allows us to run the migrations using the
migrate
function. Add a new script to the
package.json
file that executes the migration.
{
"scripts"
:
{
"db:migrate"
:
"tsx ./src/migrate.ts"
}
}
You can now run the migration script using the following command:
npm
run
db:migrate
You should see the
Migration completed
message in the terminal, indicating that the migration was successful.
Seed the database
To test the application works, we need to add some example data to our tables. Create a new file at
src/seed.ts
and add the following code to it:
// src/seed.ts
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
{ authors
,
books }
from
'./schema'
;
import
{ config }
from
'dotenv'
;
config
({ path
:
'.env'
});
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
!
);
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql);
async
function
seed
() {
await
db
.insert
(authors)
.values
([
{

:
'J.R.R. Tolkien'
,

,
}
,

This script inserts some seed data into the
authors
and
books
tables. Add a new script to the
package.json
file that runs the seeding program.
{
"scripts"
:
{
"db:seed"
:
"tsx ./src/seed.ts"
}
}
Run the seed script using the following command:
npm
run
db:seed
You should see the
Seeding completed
message in the terminal, indicating that the seed data was inserted into the database.
Implement the API endpoints
Now that the database is set up and populated with data, we can implement the API to query the authors and their books. Replace the existing
src/index.ts
file with the following code:
// src/index.ts
import
{ serve }
from
'@hono/node-server'
;
import
{ Hono }
from
'hono'
;
import
{ env }
from
'hono/adapter'
;
import
{ config }
from
'dotenv'
;
import
{ eq }
from
'drizzle-orm'
;
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
{ authors
,
books }
from
'./schema'
;
config
({ path
:
'.env'
});
const
app
=
new
Hono
();
app
.get
(
'/'
,
(c)
=>
{
return
c
.text
(
'Hello, this is a catalog of books!'
);
});
app
.get
(
'/authors'
,
async
(c)
=>
{
const
{
DATABASE_URL
}
=
env
<{ DATABASE_URL
:
string
}>(c);
const
sql
=
neon
(
DATABASE_URL
);
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql);
const
output
=
await
db
.select
()
.from
(authors);
return
c
.json
(output);
});
app
.get
(
'/books/:authorId'
,
async
(c)
=>
{
const
{
DATABASE_URL
}
=
env
<{ DATABASE_URL
:
string
}>(c);
const
sql
=
neon
(
DATABASE_URL
);
const
db
=
drizzle
(sql);
const
authorId
=
c
.
req
.param
(
'authorId'
);
const
output
=
await
db
.select
()
.from
(books)
.where
(
eq
(
books
.authorId
,
Number
(authorId)));
return
c
.json
(output);
});
const
port
=
3000
;
console
.log
(
`Server is running on port
${
port
}
`
);
serve
({
fetch
:
app
.fetch
,
port
,
});
This code sets up a simple API with two endpoints:
/authors
and
/books/:authorId
. The
/authors
endpoint returns a list of all the authors, and the
/books/:authorId
endpoint returns a list of books written by the specific author with the given
authorId
.
Run the application using the following command:
npm
run
dev
This will start a
Hono.js
server at
http://localhost:3000
. Navigate to
http://localhost:3000/authors
and
http://localhost:3000/books/1
in your browser to check that the API works as expected.
Migration after a schema change
To demonstrate how to execute a schema change, we'll add a new column to the
authors
table, listing the country of origin for each author.
Generate the new migration
Modify the code in the
src/schema.ts
file to add the new column to the
authors
table:
// src/schema.ts
import
{ pgTable
,
integer
,
serial
,
text
,
timestamp }
from
'drizzle-orm/pg-core'
;
export
const
authors
=
pgTable
(
'authors'
,
{
id
:
serial
(
'id'
)
.primaryKey
()
,
name
:
text
(
'name'
)
.notNull
()
,
bio
:
text
(
'bio'
)
,
country
:
text
(
'country'
)
,
createdAt
:
timestamp
(
'created_at'
)
.notNull
()
.defaultNow
()
,
});
export
const
books
=
pgTable
(
'books'
,
{
id
:
serial
(
'id'
)
.primaryKey
()
,
title
:
text
(
'title'
)
.notNull
()
,
authorId
:
integer
(
'author_id'
)
.references
(()
=>
authors
.id)
,
createdAt
:
timestamp
(
'created_at'
)
.notNull
()
.defaultNow
()
,
});
Now, we can run the following command to generate a new migration file:
npm
run
db:generate
This command generates a new migration file in the
drizzle
folder, with the SQL command to add the new column to the
authors
table.
Run the migration
Run the migration script using the following command:
npm
run
db:migrate
You should see the
Migration completed
message in the terminal, indicating it was successful.
Verify the schema change
To verify that the schema change was successful, run the application using the following command:
npm
run
dev
You can navigate to
http://localhost:3000/authors
in your browser to check that each author entry has a
country
field, currently set to
null
.
Conclusion
In this guide, we set up a new TypeScript project using
Hono.js
and
Drizzle
ORM and connected it to a
Neon
Postgres database. We created a schema for the database, generated and ran migrations, and implemented API endpoints to query the database.

Drizzle is a modern ORM for TypeScript that provides a simple and type-safe way to interact with your database. This guide covers the following topics:
Connect to Neon from Drizzle
Use the Neon serverless driver with Drizzle
Connect to Neon from Drizzle
To establish a basic connection from Drizzle to Neon, perform the following steps:
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.
Add a
DATABASE_URL
variable to your
.env
file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding
?sslmode=require
to the end of the connection string to ensure a
secure connection
.
Your setting will appear similar to the following:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
Use the Neon serverless driver with Drizzle
The Neon serverless driver is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript (and TypeScript) that lets you query data from serverless and edge environments. For more information about the driver, see
Neon serverless driver
.
To set up Drizzle with the Neon serverless driver, use the Drizzle driver adapter. This adapter allows you to choose a different database driver than Drizzle's default driver for communicating with your database.
Install the Neon serverless driver and
ws
packages:
npm
install
ws
@neondatabase/serverless
npm
install
-D
@types/ws
Update your Drizzle instance:
import
'dotenv/config'
;
import
{ drizzle }
from
'drizzle-orm/neon-http'
;
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
ws
from
'ws'
;
neonConfig
.webSocketConstructor
=
ws;
// To work in edge environments (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, etc.), enable querying over fetch
// neonConfig.poolQueryViaFetch = true
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
export
const
db
=
drizzle
({ client
:
sql });
You can now use Drizzle instance as you normally would with full type-safety.

Connect from Elixir with Ecto to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from Elixir with Ecto
This guide describes how to connect from an Elixir application with Ecto, which is a database wrapper and query generator for Elixir. Ecto provides an API and abstractions for interacting databases, enabling Elixir developers to query any database using similar constructs.
The instructions in this guide follow the steps outlined in the
Ecto Getting Started
guide, modified to demonstrate connecting to a Neon Serverless Postgres database. It is assumed that you have a working installation of
Elixir
.
To connect to Neon from Elixir with Ecto:
Create a database in Neon and copy the connection string
The instructions in this configuration use a database named
friends
.
To create the database:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select a project.
Select
Databases
.
Select the branch where you want to create the database.
Click
New Database
.
Enter a database name (
friends
), and select a database owner.
Click
Create
.
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a role, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you. Your connection string should look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech/friends
You will need the connection string details later in the setup.
Create an Elixir project
Create an Elixir application called
friends
.
mix
new
friends
--sup
The
--sup
option ensures that the application has a supervision tree, which is required by Ecto.
Add Ecto and Postgrex to the application
Add the Ecto and the Postgrex driver dependencies to the
mix.exs
file by updating the
deps
definition in the file to include those items. For example:
defp
deps
do
[
{:ecto_sql,
"~> 3.0"
},
{:postgrex,
">= 0.18.0"
}
]
end
Ecto provides the common querying API. The Postgrex driver acts as a bridge between Ecto and Postgres. Ecto interfaces with its own
Ecto.Adapters.Postgres
module, which communicates to Postgres through the Postgrex driver.
Install the Ecto and the Postgrex driver dependencies by running the following command in your application directory:
mix
deps.get
Configure Ecto
Run the following command in your application directory to generate the configuration required to connect from Ecto to your Neon database.
mix
ecto.gen.repo
-r
Friends.Repo
Follow these steps to complete the configuration:
The first part of the configuration generated by the
mix ecto.gen.repo
command is found in the
config/config.exs
file. Update this configuration with your Neon database connection details. Use the connection details from the Neon connection string you copied in the first part of the guide. Your
hostname
will differ from the example below.
config :friends
,
Friends
.
Repo
,
database:
"friends"
,
username:
"alex"
,
password:
"AbC123dEf"
,
hostname:
"ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-west-2.aws.neon.tech"
,
ssl: [cacerts: :public_key
.
cacerts_get
()]
The
:ssl
option is required to connect to Neon. Postgrex, since v0.18, verifies the server SSL certificate and you need to select CA trust store using
:cacerts
or
:cacertfile
options. You can use the OS-provided CA store by setting
cacerts: :public_key.cacerts_get()
. While not recommended, you can disable certificate verification by setting
ssl: [verify: :verify_none]
.
note
Postgrex has an
:idle_interval
connection parameter that defines an interval for pinging connections after a period of inactivity. The default setting is
1000ms
. If you rely on Neon's
autosuspend
feature to scale your compute to zero when your database is not active, this setting will prevent that. For more, see
Postgrex: DBConnection ConnectionError ssl send: closed
.
The second part of the configuration generated by the
mix ecto.gen.repo
command is the
Ecto.Repo
module, found in
lib/friends/repo.ex
. You shouldn't have to make any changes here, but verify that the following configuration is present:
defmodule
Friends
.
Repo
do
use
Ecto
.
Repo
,
otp_app: :friends
,
adapter:
Ecto
.
Adapters
.
Postgres
end
Ecto uses the module definition to query the database. The
otp_app
setting tells Ecto where to find the database configuration. In this case, the
:friends
application is specified, so Ecto will use the configuration defined in the that application's
config/config.exs
file. The
:adapter
option defines the Postgres adapter.
Next, the
Friends.Repo
must be defined as a supervisor within the application's supervision tree. In
lib/friends/application.ex
, make sure
Friends.Repo
is specified in the
start
function, as shown:
def
start
(
_type
,
_args
)
do
children
=
[
Friends
.
Repo
,
]
This configuration starts the Ecto process, enabling it to receive and execute the application's queries.
The final part of the configuration is to add the following line under the configuration in the
config/config.exs
file that you updated in the first step:
config :friends
,
ecto_repos: [
Friends
.
Repo
]
This line tells the application about the new repo, allowing you to run commands such as
mix ecto.migrate
, which you will use in a later step to create a table in your database.
Create a migration and add a table
Your
friends
database is currently empty. It has no tables or data. In this step, you will add a table. To do so, you will create a "migration" by running the following command in your application directory:
mix
ecto.gen.migration
create_people
The command generates an empty migration file in
priv/repo/migrations
, which looks like this:
defmodule
Friends
.
Repo
.
Migrations
.
CreatePeople
do
use
Ecto
.
Migration
def
change
do
end
end
Add code to the migration file to create a table called
people
. For example:
defmodule
Friends
.
Repo
.
Migrations
.
CreatePeople
do
use
Ecto
.
Migration
def
change
do
create
table
(:people)
do
add :first_name
,
:string
add :last_name
,
:string
add :age
,
:integer
end
end
end
To run the migration and create the
people
table in your database, which also verifies your connection to Neon, run the following command from your application directory:
mix
ecto.migrate
The output of this command should appear similar to the following:
14:30:04.924
[info]  == Running 20230524172817 Friends.Repo.Migrations.CreatePeople.change/0 forward
14:30:04.925
[info]  create table people
14:30:05.014
[info]  == Migrated 20230524172817 in 0.0s
You can use the
Tables
feature in the Neon Console to view the table that was created:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select a project.
Select
Tables
from the sidebar.
Select the Branch, Database (
friends
), and the schema (
public
). You should see the
people
table along with a
schema_migration
table that was created by the migration.
Application code
You can find the application code for the example above on GitHub.

Next steps
The
Ecto Getting Started Guide
provides additional steps that you can follow to create a schema, insert data, and run queries. See
Creating the schema
in the
Ecto Getting Started Guide
to pick up where the steps in this guide leave off.
Usage notes
Suppose you have
PGHOST
environment variable on your system set to something other than your Neon hostname. In that case, this hostname will be used instead of the Neon
hostname
defined in your Ecto Repo configuration when running
mix ecto
commands. To avoid this issue, you can either set the
PGHOST
environment variable to your Neon hostname or specify
PGHOST=""
when running
mix ecto
commands; for example:
PGHOST="" mix ecto.migrate
.
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature scales computes to zero after 300 seconds (5 minutes) of inactivity, which can result in a
connection not available
error when running
mix ecto
commands. Typically, a Neon compute takes a few hundred milliseconds to transition from
Idle
to
Active
. Wait a second or two and try running the command again. Alternatively, consider the strategies outlined in
Connection latency and timeouts
to manage connection issues resulting from compute suspension.

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Entity Framework
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Entity Framework project
Entity Framework
is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications. It simplifies database access by allowing developers to work with domain-specific objects and properties without focusing on the underlying database tables and columns. Entity Framework also provides a powerful migration system that enables you to define and manage database schema changes over time.
This guide demonstrates how to use Entity Framework with the Neon Postgres database. We'll create a simple .NET application and walk through the process of setting up the database, defining models, and generating and running migrations to manage schema changes.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A recent version of the
.NET SDK
installed on your local machine. This guide uses .NET 8.0, which is the current Long-Term Support (LTS) version.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select a project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It should appear similar to the following:
postgresql://username:password@hostname/dbname?sslmode
=require
The Postgres client library we use in this guide requires the connection string to be in the following format:
Host
=
hostname
;Port
=
5432
;Database
=
dbname
;Username
=
username
;Password
=
password
;SSLMode
=
Require
Construct the connection string in this format using the correct values for your Neon connection URI. Keep it handy for later use.
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings, which you can find by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can be prone to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Setting up the Entity Framework project
Create a new .NET project
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new .NET console application:
dotnet
new
console
-o
guide-neon-entityframework
cd
guide-neon-entityframework
Install dependencies
Run the following commands to install the necessary NuGet packages:
dotnet
add
package
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet
add
package
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet
add
Microsoft.AspNetCore.App
dotnet
add
package
Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
dotnet
add
package
dotenv.net
These packages include the Entity Framework Core libraries, the design-time components for migrations, and the Npgsql provider for PostgreSQL.
We will also need the
EF Core
tools to generate and run migrations. Install the
dotnet-ef
tool globally:
dotnet
tool
install
--global
dotnet-ef
Set up the database configuration
Create a new file named
.env
in the project root directory and add the following configuration:
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
Replace
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
with the
formatted
connection string you constructed earlier.
Defining data models and running migrations
Create the data models
Create a new file named
Models.cs
in the project directory and define the data models for your application:
#
Models.cs
using
System
;
using
Microsoft
.
EntityFrameworkCore
;
namespace
NeonEFMigrations
{

This code defines two entities:
Author
and
Book
. The
Author
entity represents an author with properties for name, bio, and created timestamp. The
Book
entity represents a book with properties for title, author (as a foreign key to the
Author
entity), and created timestamp.
Also, create a new file named
ApplicationDbContext.cs
in the project directory and add the following code:

class derives from
DbContext
and represents the database context. It includes the method where we configure the database connection and seed the database at initialization. We also set default values for the
CreatedAt
properties of the
Author

Book
entities.
Add seeding script
To seed the database with some initial data, create another script named
ModelBuilderExtensions.cs
in the project directory and add the following code:

This code defines a static method
Seed
that populates the database with some initial authors and books. Entity framework will include this data when generating database migrations.
Generate migration files
To generate migration files based on the defined models, run the following command:
dotnet
ef
migrations
add
InitialCreate
This command detects the new
Author
and
Book
entities and generates migration files in the
Migrations
directory to create the corresponding tables in the database.
Apply the migration
To apply the migration and create the tables in the Neon Postgres database, run the following command:
dotnet
ef
database
update
This command executes the migration file and creates the necessary tables in the database. It will also seed the database with the initial data defined in the
Seed
method.
Creating the web application
Implement the API endpoints
The project directory has a
Program.cs
file that contains the application entry point. Replace the contents of this file with the following code:
#
Program.cs
using
Microsoft
.
EntityFrameworkCore
;
using
Microsoft
.
AspNetCore
.
Builder
;
using
Microsoft
.

.
DependencyInjection
;
using
GuideNeonEF
;
var
builder
=
WebApplication
.
CreateBuilder
(args);
builder
.
Services
.
AddDbContext
<
ApplicationDbContext
>();
var
app
=
builder
.
Build
();
app
.
UseRouting
();
app
.
MapGet
(
"/authors"
,
async
(
ApplicationDbContext
db)
=>
await
db
.
Authors
.
ToListAsync
());
app
.
MapGet
(
"/books/{authorId}"
,
async
(
int
authorId
,
ApplicationDbContext
db)
=>
await
db
.
Books
.
Where
(b
=>
b
.
AuthorId
==
authorId).
ToListAsync
());
app
.
Run
();
This code sets up a simple web application with two endpoints:
/authors
and
/books/[authorId]
. The
/authors
endpoint returns a list of all authors, while the
/books/[authorId]
endpoint returns a list of books written by the author with the specified ID.
Test the application
To test the application, run the following command:
dotnet
run
This will start a local web server at
http://localhost:5000
. Navigate to these endpoints in your browser to view the seeded data.
curl
http://localhost:5000/authors
curl
http://localhost:5000/books/1
Applying schema changes
We'll see how to handle schema changes by adding a new property
Country
to the
Author
entity to store the author's country of origin.
Update the data model
Open the
Models.cs
file and add a new property to the
Author
entity:
#
Models.cs
public
class
Author
{
public
int
Id {
get
;
set
; }
public
string
Name {
get
;
set
; }
public
string
Bio {
get
;
set
; }
public
DateTime
CreatedAt {
get
;
set
; }
public
string
Country {
get
;
set
; }
}
Also, update the seed data entries for the
Author
model to include the
Country
property:
#
ModelBuilderExtensions.cs
namespace
GuideNeonEF
{
public
static
class
ModelBuilderExtensions
{
public
static
void
Seed
(
this
ModelBuilder
modelBuilder)
{
var
authors
=
new
[]
{
new
Author
{ Id
=
1
,
Name
=
"J.R.R. Tolkien"
,
Bio
=
"The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings."
,
Country
=
"United Kingdom"
}
,
new
Author
{ Id
=
2
,
Name
=
"George R.R. Martin"
,
Bio
=
"The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire."
,
Country
=
"United States"
}
,
new
Author
{ Id
=
3
,
Name
=
"J.K. Rowling"
,
Bio
=
"The creator of the Harry Potter series."
,
Country
=
"United Kingdom"
}
};
modelBuilder
.
Entity
<
Author
>().
HasData
(authors);
..
.
}
}
}
Generate and run the migration
To generate a new migration file for the above schema change, run the following command in the terminal:
dotnet
ef
migrations
add
AddCountryToAuthor
This command detects the updated
Author
entity and generates a new migration file to add the new column to the corresponding table in the database. It will also include upserting the seed data with the new property added.
Now, to apply the migration, run the following command:
dotnet
ef
database
update
Test the schema change
Run the application again:
dotnet
run
Now, if you navigate to the
/authors
endpoint, you should see the new
Country
property included in the response.
curl
http://localhost:5000/authors

Use Exograph with Neon
Build GraphQL backends in minutes with Exograph and Neon
This guide was contributed by the Exograph team
Exograph
is a new approach to building GraphQL backends. With it, you can effortlessly create flexible, secure, high-performing GraphQL backends in minutes. Powered by a Rust-based runtime, Exograph ensures fast startup times, efficient execution, and minimal memory consumption. Exograph comes equipped with a comprehensive set of tools designed to support every stage of the development lifecycle: from initial development to deployment to ongoing maintenance.
Exograph supports Postgres for data persistence, which makes it a great fit to use with Neon.
Prerequisites
Exograph CLI. See
Install Exograph
.
A Neon project. See
Create a Neon project
.
Create a backend with Exograph
Let's create a starter project with Exograph. Run the following commands:
exo
new
todo
cd
todo
You can check the code it created by examining the
src/index.exo
file (which has a definition for the
Todo
type). If you would like, you can try the
yolo
mode by trying the
exo yolo
command.
Next, let's set up the Neon database.
Create the schema in Neon
Navigate to the Neon Console, select your project, and copy the connection string, which will look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
.
Create schema in Neon using Exograph CLI:
exo
schema
create
|
psql
<
the
connection
strin
g
>
Launch the backend
EXO_POSTGRES_URL
=<
the
connection
strin
g
>
exo
dev
It will print the necessary information for connecting to the backend.

That's it! You can now open
http://localhost:9876/playground
in your browser to see the GraphQL Playground.
You can create a todo by running the following mutation:
mutation
{
createTodo(data: {
title
:
"Set up Exograph with Neon"
,
completed
:
true
}) {
id
}
}
To get all todos, try the following query:
query
{
todos {
id
title
completed
}
}
And you should see the todo you just added. Please follow Exograph's
guide to creating a simple application
for more details.
Learn more
In this guide, we have created a basic todo backend using Exograph and Neon. You can extend this further by establishing relationships between types, implementing access control rules, and integrating custom business logic. Check out Exograph's
application tutorial
for more details.
To deploy Exograph in the cloud and connect it to Neon, follow the guide below (select the "External Database" tab for Neon-specific instructions in each case):

Use FerretDB with Neon
Add MongoDB compatibility to your Neon database with FerretDB
FerretDB is an open source document database that adds MongoDB compatibility to other databases, including Postgres. By using FerretDB, developers can access familiar MongoDB features and tools using the same syntax and commands for many of their use cases.
In this guide, you'll learn about FerretDB and how you can add MongoDB compatibility to your Neon Postgres database.
Advantages of FerretDB
The benefits of using FerretDB include:
MongoDB compatibility
FerretDB gives you access to the syntax, tools, querying language, and commands available in MongoDB for many common use cases. MongoDB is known for its simple and intuitive NoSQL query language which is widely used by many developers. By using FerretDB, you can enable Postgres databases like Neon to run MongoDB workloads.
For related information, see
MongoDB Compatibility - What's Really Important?
Open source
As an open source document database, you won't be at risk of vendor lock-in. Since MongoDB's license change to Server Side Public License (SSPL), there's been a lot of confusion regarding what this means for users and what it would mean for their applications. According to the Open Source Initiative – the steward of open source and the set of rules that define open source software – SSPL is not considered open source.
FerretDB is licensed under Apache 2.0, makes it a good option for users looking for a MongoDB alternative.
Multiple backend options
FerretDB currently supports Postgres and SQLite backends, with many ongoing efforts to support other backends. Many databases built on Postgres can serve as a backend for FerretDB, including Neon. That means you can take advantage of all the features available in the backend of your choice to scale and manage your database infrastructure without fear of vendor lock-in.
To learn more, see
the FerretDB documentation
.
Prerequisites
The prerequisites for this guide include the following:
A Neon account and project. See
Sign up
.
A database. This guide uses a database named
ferretdb
. It's easy to create a database in Neon. See
Create a database
for instructions.
Docker. For instructions, see
Get Docker
. To verify your installation or check if you already have Docker installed, you can run
docker --version
.
The
mongosh
command-line tool. For installation instructions, see
Install mongosh
. If you are a macOS user, you can quickly install with Homebrew:
brew install mongosh
.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Your database connection string will look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/ferretdb
Run FerretDB with Neon via Docker
Execute the following command to run FerretDB in a Docker container and connect it to your Neon Postgres database (
NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
):
docker
run
docker
run
-p
27017:27017
-e
FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=
<
NEON_DB_CONNECTION_STRIN
G
>
ghcr.io/ferretdb/ferretdb
Test via mongosh
From another terminal, test to see if the FerretDB instance is connected to your Neon database using
mongosh
. To connect via
mongosh
, you will need a connection string. Use the credentials for your Neon database connection string.
So in this case, the MongoDB connection string will be:
mongosh
'mongodb://<postgres-username>:<postgres-password>@127.0.0.1/ferretdb?authMechanism=PLAIN'
This will connect you directly to the FerretDB instance where you can run MongoDB commands.

Update a record in FerretDB
Next, you need to update the "Jordan" record to reflect his current position as a
SF
. To do this, we can just run an
updateOne
command to target just that particular player:
db.players.updateOne(
{ player_name
:
"Jordan"
},
{ $set
:
{ position
:
"SF"
} }
);
Query the collection to see if the changes have been made:
ferretdb> db.players.find({player_name

View your database on Neon
In addition to a document database view of the collection in FerretDB, you can also view and query the data in Neon.
To view your current documents, go to the Neon
Dashboard
and select
Tables
from the sidebar. Then, from the
Schema
menu, select
ferretdb
. FerretDB stores the documents in Postgres as
JSONB
data.
To query the data for a specific player via SQL, you can do so via the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client like
psql
:
SELECT
_jsonb
FROM
ferretdb.players_a90eae09
WHERE
_jsonb
->>
'player_name'
=
'Jordan'
;

File storage
Store files in external object storage and file management services and track metadata in Neon
Applications often need to handle file uploads and storage, from user avatars and documents to images and other media. Neon does not yet provide a native file storage solution. Instead, we recommend combining Neon with a specialized storage service.
The typical pattern looks like this:
Upload files from your application (client or backend) to an object storage provider or file management service.
Store references—such as the file URL, unique key, or identifier—and related metadata like user ID, upload timestamp, file type, size, and permissions in your Neon Postgres database.
This pattern separates file storage from relational data management, with purpose-built services like S3 or R2 handling file storage and Neon managing your data.
Options for external storage
You can integrate Neon with a variety of storage solutions:
S3-compatible object storage: Services like
AWS S3
,
Cloudflare R2
, and
Backblaze B2
offer file storage via the widely-adopted S3 API.
File and media management SaaS platforms: Services like
ImageKit
,
Cloudinary
,
Uploadcare
or
Filestack
provide higher-level abstractions, often including additional features like image optimization, transformations, and SDKs, while managing the underlying storage infrastructure for you.

Get started with Flyway and Neon
Learn how to manage schema changes in Neon with Flyway
Flyway is a database migration tool that facilitates version control for databases. It allows developers to manage and track changes to the database schema, ensuring that the database evolves consistently across different environments.
This guide steps you through installing the Flyway command-line tool, configuring Flyway to connect to a Neon database, and running database migrations. The guide follows the setup described in the
Flyway command-line quickstart
.
Prerequisites
A Neon account. See
Sign up
.
A Neon project. See
Create your first project
.
A database. This guide uses the ready-to-use
neondb
database. You can create your own database if you like. See
Create a database
for instructions.
Download and extract Flyway
Download the latest version of the
Flyway command-line tool
.
Extract the Flyway files. For example:
cd
~/Downloads
tar
-xzvf

Connect a Go application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Go application
To connect to Neon from a Go application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
To create a Neon project:
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Configure Go application connection settings
Connecting to Neon requires configuring connection settings in your Go project's
.go
file.
note
Neon is fully compatible with the
sql/db
package and common Postgres drivers, such as
pgx
.
Specify the connection settings in your
.go
file, as shown in the following example:
package
main
import
(
"context"
"database/sql"
"fmt"
_
"github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib"
)
func
main
() {
connStr
:=
"postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
db, err
:=
sql.
Open
(
"postgres"
, connStr)
if
err
!=
nil
{
panic
(err)
}
defer
db.
Close
()
var
version
string
if
err
:=
db.
QueryRow
(
"select version()"
).
Scan
(
&
version); err
!=
nil
{
panic
(err)
}
fmt.
Printf
(
"version=
%s
\n"
, version)

Alternatively, you can use the native pgx driver without the database/sql abstraction:
package
main
import
(
"context"
"fmt"
"github.com/jackc/pgx/v5"
)
func
main
() {
connStr
:=
"postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
conn, err
:=
pgx.
Connect
(context.
Background
(), connStr)
if
err
!=
nil
{
panic
(err)
}
defer
conn.
Close
(context.
Background
())
var
version
string
err
=
conn.
QueryRow
(context.
Background
(),
"select version()"
).
Scan
(
&
version)
if
err
!=
nil
{
panic
(err)
}
fmt.
Printf
(
"version=

Use Grafbase Edge Resolvers with Neon
Learn how to build and deploy serverless GraphQL backends with Grafbase and Neon
This guide was contributed by Josep Vidal from Grafbase
Grafbase allows you to combine your data sources into a centralized GraphQL endpoint and deploy a serverless GraphQL backend.
This guide describes how to create a GraphQL API using Grafbase and use Grafbase
Edge Resolvers
with the
Neon serverless driver
to interact with your Neon database at the edge.
The example project in this guide simulates a marketplace of products, where the product price is dynamically calculated based on data retrieved from your Neon database.
Prerequisites
The
Grafbase CLI
A Neon project. See
Create a Neon project
.
Create a backend with Grafbase
Create a directory and initialize your Grafbase project by running the following commands:
npx
grafbase
init
grafbase-neon
cd
grafbase-neon
In your project directory, open the
grafbase/schema.graphql
file and replace the existing content with the following schema:
extend
type
Mutation
{
addProductVisit(productId:
ID
!
):
ID
!
@resolver
(name:
"add-product-visit"
)
}
type
Product
@model
{
name:
String
!
price:
Float
@resolver
(name:
"product/price"
)
}
Create the schema in Neon
Navigate to the Neon Console and select your project.
Open the Neon
SQL Editor
and run the following
CREATE TABLE
statement:
CREATE
TABLE
product_visits
(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
, product_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
);
The
product_visits
table stores product page view data that the application uses to dynamically calculate a product price.
Create the resolver files
The schema includes an
addProductVisit
query and
prodcut/price
field. Create resolvers for those by creating the following files in your project directory:
grafbase/resolvers/add-product-visit.js
grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js
You can use the following commands to create the files:
cd
grafbase
mkdir
resolvers
cd
resolvers
touch
add-product-visit.js
mkdir
product
cd
product
touch
price.js
You will add code to these files in a later step.
Install the Neon serverless driver
Inside the
grafbase
directory in your project, run the following commands to install the Neon serverless driver:
cd
..
npm
init
-y
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Retrieve your Neon connection string
A database connection string is required to forward queries to your Neon database. You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
Navigate to the Neon
Project Dashboard
.
Click
Connect
and copy the connection string for your database. The connection string should appear similar to the following:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Add a
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to your
grafbase/.env
file and set the value to your connection string. For example:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Add code to the resolvers
In the
resolvers/product/add-product-visit
resolver, add the following code, which inserts a new record in the
product_visits
table with a
productId
each time the resolver is queried.
# grafbase
/
resolvers
/
add
-
product
-
visit
.js
import
{ Client }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
export
default
async
function
Resolver
(_
,
{ productId }) {
const
client
=
new
Client
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
)
await
client
.connect
()
await
client
.query
(
`INSERT INTO product_visits (product_id) VALUES ('
${
productId
}
')`
)
await
client
.end
()
return
productId
}
In the
grafbase/resolvers/product/price.js
resolver, add the following code, which calculates the product price based on the number of product visits (the number of visits represents customer interest in the product).
# grafbase
/
resolvers
/
product
/
price
.js
import
{ Client }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
export
default
async
function
Resolver
({ id }) {
const
client
=
new
Client
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
)
await
client
.connect
()
const
{
rows: [{
count
}]
}
=
await
client
.query
(
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM product_visits WHERE product_id = '
${
id
}
'`
)
await
client
.end
()
return
Number
.parseInt
(count)
}
Test the resolvers
To test the resolvers with Neon, perform the following steps:
Start the Grafbase CLI:
npx
grafbase
dev
Go to
http://localhost:4000
and execute the following GraphQL mutation, which creates a new product:
mutation
{
productCreate(input: {
name
:
"Super Product"
}) {
product {
id
name
}
}
}
Use the product
id
to execute the following mutation, which adds a row to the database table in Neon:
mutation
{
addProductVisit(productId:
"PREVIOUS_PRODUCT_ID"
)
}
Query the same product, and check the price:
query
{
product(input: {
by
:
"PREVIOUS_PRODUCT_ID"
}) {
id
name
price
}
}
Run the query several more times and watch how the price increases as "interest" in the product increases.

.
Add Neon as a data source
The following steps describe how to navigate to Hasura Cloud and connect to your Neon project.
Navigate to
Hasura Cloud
and sign up or log in.
Click
Create Project
to create a Hasura Cloud project or click
Launch Console
to open an existing project.
In the Hasura Console, select
Data
from the top navigation bar.
Click
Postgres
>
Connect Existing Database
.
Paste your connection string into the
Database URL
field.
tip
To enhance security and manageability, consider using environment variables in Hasura instead of hardcoding the connection string. To do this, navigate to
Hasura Project settings
>
Env vars
>
New env var
and create a new variable (e.g.,
NEON_DATABASE_URL
) with your connection string as its value.
Then, in the connection tab, select
Connect database via Environment variable
and enter the variable name you created. This approach keeps your connection string secure and simplifies future updates.
Enter a display name for your database in the
Database name
field, and click
Connect Database
.
Hasura Cloud connects to your Neon project and automatically discovers the default
public
schema.
To start exploring Hasura's GraphQL API with data stored in Neon, see
Load a template in Hasura
.
Load a template in Hasura (optional)
Optionally, after connecting from your Hasura project to Neon, you can explore Hasura's GraphQL API by loading a template from Hasura's template gallery. Follow these steps to load the
Welcome to Hasura
template, which creates
customer
and
order
tables and populates them with sample data.
In the Hasura Console, select
Data
.
Under
Data Manager
, select your database.
From the
Template Gallery
, select
Welcome to Hasura
to install the template.
To view the newly created tables from the Neon Console:
In the Hasura Console, select
Data
>
Manage your Neon databases
to open the Neon Console.
In the Neon Console, select your project.
Select the
Tables
tab. The newly created
customer
and
order
tables should appear under the
Tables
heading in the sidebar.
Import existing data to Neon
If you are migrating from Hasura with Heroku Postgres to Neon, refer to the
Import data from Heroku
guide for data import instructions. For general data import instructions, see
Import data from Postgres
.
Maximum connections configuration
In Neon, the maximum number of concurrent connections is defined according to the size of your compute. For example, a 0.25 vCPU compute in Neon supports 112 connections. The connection limit is higher with larger compute sizes (see
How to size your compute
). You can also enable connection pooling in Neon to support up to 10,000 concurrent connections. However, it is important to note that Hasura has a
HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_CONNECTIONS
setting that limits Postgres connections to
50
by default. If you start encountering errors related to "max connections", try increasing the value of this setting as a first step, staying within the connection limit for your Neon compute. For information about the Hasura connection limit setting, refer to the
Hasura Postgres configuration documentation
.
Scale to zero considerations
Neon suspends a compute after five minutes (300 seconds) of inactivity. This behavior can be disabled on Neon's paid plans. For more information, refer to
Configuring Scale to zero for Neon computes
.
If you rely on Neon's scale to zero feature to minimize database usage, note that certain Hasura configuration options can keep your Neon compute in an active state:
Event triggers
may periodically poll your Neon database for new events.
Cron triggers
can invoke HTTP endpoints that execute custom business logic involving your Neon database.
Source Health Checks
can keep your Neon compute active if the metadata database resides in Neon.

Deploy Your Node.js App with Neon Postgres on Heroku
A step-by-step guide to deploying a Node application with a Neon Postgres database on Heroku
Heroku
is a popular platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It simplifies the deployment process, making it a favorite among developers for its ease of use and integration capabilities.
This guide walks you through deploying a simple Node.js application connected to a Neon Postgres database, on Heroku.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A Heroku account. Sign up at
Heroku
to get started.
Git installed on your local machine. Heroku uses Git for version control and deployment.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Setting Up Your Neon Database
Initialize a New Project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Click
New Project
to create a new project.
In your project dashboard, go to the
SQL Editor
and run the following SQL command to create a new table:
CREATE
TABLE
music_albums
(
album_id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
title
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
,
artist
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO
music_albums (title, artist)
VALUES
(
'Rumours'
,
'Fleetwood Mac'
),
(
'Abbey Road'
,
'The Beatles'
),
(
'Dark Side of the Moon'
,
'Pink Floyd'
),
(
'Thriller'
,
'Michael Jackson'
);
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Implementing the Node.js Application
We'll create a simple Express application that connects to our Neon database and retrieves the list of music albums. Run the following commands in your terminal to set it up:
mkdir
neon-heroku-example
&&
cd
neon-heroku-example
npm
init
-y
&&
npm
pkg
set
type=
"module"
&&
npm
pkg
set
scripts.start=
"node index.js"
npm
install
express
pg
touch
.env
We use the
npm pkg set type="module"
command to enable ES6 module support in our project. We'll also create a new
.env
file to store the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable, which we'll use to connect to our Neon database. Lastly, we install the
pg
library which is the Postgres driver we use to connect to our database.
In the
.env
file, store your Neon database connection string:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
Now, create a new file named
index.js
and add the following code:
import
express
from
'express'
;
import
pkg
from
'pg'
;
const
app
=
express
();
const
port
=
process
.
env
.
PORT
||
3000
;
// Parse JSON bodies for this app
app
.use
(
express
.json
());
// Create a new pool using your Neon database connection string
const
{
Pool
}
=
pkg;
const
pool
=
new
Pool
({ connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
});
app
.get
(
'/'
,
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
try
{
// Fetch the list of music albums from your database using the postgres connection
const
{
rows
}
=
await
pool
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM music_albums;'
);
res
.json
(rows);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Failed to fetch albums'
,
error);
res
.status
(
500
)
.json
({ error
:
'Internal Server Error'
});
}
});
// Start the server
app
.listen
(port
,
()
=>
{
console
.log
(
`Server running on http://localhost:
${
port
}
`
);
});
This code sets up an Express server that listens for requests on port 3000. When a request is made to the
URL
, the server queries the
music_albums
table in your Neon database and returns the results as JSON.
We can test this application locally by running:
node
--env-file=.env
index.js
Now, navigate to
http://localhost:3000/
in your browser to check it returns the sample data from the
music_albums
table.
Deploying to Heroku
Create a New Heroku App
We will use the
Heroku CLI
to deploy our application to Heroku manually. You can install it on your machine by following the instructions
here
. Once installed, log in to your Heroku account using:
❯
heroku
login
›
Warning:
Our
terms
of
service
have
changed:
›
https://dashboard.heroku.com/terms-of-service
heroku:
Press
any
key
to
open

the
browser
to
login
or
q
to
exit:
Opening
browser
to
https://cli-auth.heroku.com/auth/cli/browser/...
You will be prompted to log in to your Heroku account in the browser. After logging in, you can close the browser and return to your terminal.
Before creating the Heroku application, we need to initialize a new Git repository in our project folder:
git
init
&&
echo
"node_modules"
>
.gitignore
&&
echo
".env"
>>
.gitignore
git
branch
-M
main
git
add
.
&&
git
commit
-m
"Initial commit"
Next, we can create a new app on Heroku using the following command. This creates a new Heroku app with the name
neon-heroku-example
, and sets up a new Git remote for the app called
heroku
.
heroku
create
neon-heroku-example
You'll also need to set the
DATABASE_URL
on Heroku to your Neon database connection string:
heroku
config:set
DATABASE_URL=
'NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING'
-a
neon-heroku-example
Deploy Your Application
To deploy your application to Heroku, use the following command to push your code to the
heroku
remote. Heroku will automatically detect that your application is a Node.js application, install the necessary dependencies and deploy it.
>
git push heroku main
.
.
.
remote:
-----
>

Once the deployment is complete, you should see a message with the URL of your deployed application. Navigate to this URL in your browser to see your application live on Heroku.
You've now successfully deployed a Node.js application on Heroku that connects to a Neon Postgres database. For further customization and scaling options, you can explore the Heroku and Neon documentation.
Removing Your Application and Neon Project
To remove your application from Heroku, select the app from your
Heroku dashboard
. Navigate to the
Settings
tab and scroll down to the end to find the "Delete App" option.
To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under

Connect a Hono application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Hono application
Hono
is a lightweight, multi-runtime web framework for the Edge, Node.js, Deno, Bun, and other runtimes. This topic describes how to create a Neon project and access it from a Hono application.
To create a Neon project and access it from a Hono application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a Hono project and add dependencies
Create a Hono project if you do not have one. For instructions, see
Quick Start
, in the Hono documentation.
Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Store your Neon credentials
Add a
.env
file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find your connection details by clicking
Connect
on the Neon
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
DATABASE_URL
=
"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>?sslmode=require"
Configure the Postgres client
In your Hono application (e.g., in
src/index.ts
or a specific route file), import the driver and use it within your route handlers.
Here's how you can set up a simple route to query the database:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ Hono }
from
'hono'
;
import
{ serve }
from
'@hono/node-server'
;
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
app
=
new
Hono
();
app
.get
(
'/'
,
async
(c)
=>
{
try
{
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
response
=
await
sql
`SELECT version()`
;
return
c
.json
({ version
:
response[
0
]?.version });
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Database query failed:'
,
error);
return
c
.text
(
'Failed to connect to database'
,
500
);
}
});
serve
(app);
5. Run the app
Start your Hono development server. You can use the following command:
npm
run
dev
Navigate to your application's URL (
localhost:3000
). You should see a JSON response with the PostgreSQL version:
{
"version"
:
"PostgreSQL 17.4 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 12.2.0-14) 12.2.0, 64-bit"
}
The specific version may vary depending on the PostgreSQL version you are using.

Media storage with ImageKit.io
Store files via ImageKit.io and track metadata in Neon
ImageKit.io
is a cloud-based image and video optimization and delivery platform. It provides real-time manipulation, storage, and delivery via a global CDN, simplifying media management for web and mobile applications.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate ImageKit.io with Neon. You'll learn how to upload files directly from the client-side to ImageKit.io using securely generated authentication parameters from your backend, and then store the resulting file metadata (like the ImageKit File ID and URL) in your Neon database.
Setup steps
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create an ImageKit.io account and get credentials
Sign up for a free or paid account at
ImageKit.io
.
Once logged in, navigate to the
Developer options
section in the dashboard sidebar.
Under
API Keys
, note your
Public Key
,
Private Key
, and
URL Endpoint
. These are essential for interacting with the ImageKit API and SDKs.
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need a table in Neon to store metadata about the files uploaded to ImageKit.io. This allows your application to reference the media stored in ImageKit.
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a client like
psql
. Create a table to store relevant details:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
imagekit_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
file_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
-- ImageKit.io unique File ID
file_url
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- ImageKit CDN URL for the file
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
-- User associated with the file
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Run the SQL statement. You can customize this table by adding or removing columns (like
width
,
height
,
tags
, etc.) based on the information you need from ImageKit and your application's requirements.
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, remember to apply appropriate access policies to the
imagekit_files
table. This controls who can view or modify the object references stored in Neon based on your RLS rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata in Neon. Access control for the actual files on ImageKit is managed via ImageKit features (like private files or signed URLs, if needed). The default setup makes files publicly accessible via their URL.
Upload files to ImageKit.io and store metadata in Neon
The recommended approach for client-side uploads is to generate secure
authentication parameters
on your backend. The client (e.g., a web browser) uses these parameters, along with your public API key, to upload the file directly to ImageKit's Upload API. After a successful upload, the client sends the returned metadata (like
fileId
and
url
) back to your backend to be saved in Neon.
This requires two backend endpoints:
/generate-auth-params
: Generates temporary authentication parameters (
token
,
expire
,
signature
).
/save-metadata
: Receives file metadata from the client after a successful upload to ImageKit and saves it to the Neon database.
JavaScript
Python
We'll use
Hono
for the server,
imagekit
for ImageKit interaction, and
@neondatabase/serverless
for Neon.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install
imagekit
@neondatabase/serverless
@hono/node-server
hono
dotenv
Create a
.env
file with your credentials:
# ImageKit.io Credentials
IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY
=
your_imagekit_public_key
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY
=
your_imagekit_private_key
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT
=
your_imagekit_url_endpoint
# Neon Connection String
DATABASE_URL
=
your_neon_database_connection_string

Explanation
Setup:
Initializes the Neon database client (
sql
), the Hono web framework (
app
), and the ImageKit Node.js SDK (
imagekit
) using credentials from environment variables.
Authentication:
Includes a placeholder
authMiddleware
.
Replace this with your actual user authentication logic
to ensure only authenticated users can generate upload parameters and save metadata.
API endpoints:
/generate-auth-params
(GET):
Uses the ImageKit SDK's
getAuthenticationParameters()
method to create a short-lived
token
,
expire
timestamp, and
signature
. These are returned to the client.
/save-metadata
(POST):
This endpoint is called by the client
after
it has successfully uploaded a file directly to ImageKit's Upload API. The client sends the relevant metadata returned by ImageKit (like
fileId
,
url
,
thumbnailUrl
, etc.). The endpoint then inserts this metadata, along with the authenticated
userId
, into the
imagekit_files
table in Neon.
Testing the upload workflow
This workflow involves getting authentication parameters from your backend, using those parameters to upload the file directly to ImageKit via
curl
, and then notifying your backend to save the metadata.
Get authentication parameters:
Send a
GET
request to your backend's
/generate-auth-params
endpoint.
curl
-X
GET
http://localhost:3000/generate-auth-params
Expected response:
A JSON object containing the necessary parameters. For example:
{
"success"
:
true
,
"token"
:

Upload file directly to ImageKit:
Use the parameters obtained in Step 1, your
ImageKit Public Key
, and the file path to send a
POST
request with
multipart/form-data
directly to the ImageKit Upload API.
curl
-X
POST
https://upload.imagekit.io/api/v1/files/upload
\
-F
"file=@/path/to/your/test-image.png"
\
-F
"publicKey=<YOUR_IMAGEKIT_PUBLIC_KEY>"

\
-F
"signature=<SIGNATURE_FROM_STEP_1>"
\
-F
"fileName=test-image.png"
\
-F
"useUniqueFileName=true"
Expected response (from ImageKit):
A successful upload returns a JSON object with details about the uploaded file. Note the
fileId
,
url
, etc.
{
"fileId"
:
"<YOUR_FILE_ID>"

,
"AITags"
:
null
}
Save metadata:
Send a
POST
request to your backend's
/save-metadata
endpoint, providing the key details (like
fileId
,
url
) received from ImageKit in Step 2.
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/save-metadata
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-d
'{
"fileId": "<FILE_ID_FROM_STEP_2>",
"url": "<URL_FROM_STEP_2>"
}'
Expected response (from your backend):
{
"success"
:
true
}
Expected outcome:
The file is successfully uploaded to your ImageKit Media Library.
You can verify a new row corresponding to the uploaded file exists in your
imagekit_files
table in Neon.
Accessing file metadata and files
With metadata stored in Neon, your application can easily retrieve references to the media hosted on ImageKit.io.
Query the
imagekit_files
table from your application's backend whenever you need to display or link to uploaded files.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve files associated with a specific user:
SELECT
id,
-- Your database primary key
file_id,
-- ImageKit File ID
file_url,
-- Base ImageKit CDN URL for the file
user_id,
upload_timestamp
FROM
imagekit_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
;
-- Use the actual authenticated user ID
Using the data:
The query returns rows containing the file metadata stored in Neon.
The
file_url
is the direct link to the file on ImageKit's CDN. You can use this directly in
<img>
tags, video players, or links.
ImageKit transformations:
A key benefit of ImageKit is real-time manipulation. You can append transformation parameters directly to the
file_url
to resize, crop, format, or optimize the media on-the-fly. For example,
file_url + '?tr=w-300,h-200'
would resize an image to 300x200 pixels. Learn more on
ImageKit transformation docs
for possibilities.
This pattern separates media storage, optimization, and delivery (handled by ImageKit.io) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon).

Connect a Java application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect with JDBC or Spring Data
This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or from a Spring Data project that uses JDBC.
The JDBC API is a Java API for relational databases. Postgres has a well-supported open-source JDBC driver which can be used to access Neon. All popular Java frameworks use JDBC internally. To connect to Neon, you are only required to provide a connection URL.
For additional information about JDBC, refer to the JDBC API documentation, and the
PostgreSQL JDBC Driver documentation
.
To connect to Neon with JDBC or from a Spring Data project:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
To create a Neon project:
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Connect
Connect with JDBC
For a JDBC connection URL, replace the variables in the following URL string with your Neon project ID, database name, user, and password:
jdbc
:
postgresql
:
//[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require
You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Connect from Spring Data
Spring Data relies on JDBC and Postgres drivers to connect to Postgres databases, such as Neon. If you are starting your project with Spring Initializr or connecting from an existing Spring Data project, ensure that the
PostgreSQL database driver
dependency is installed.
Connecting from a Spring Data project requires specifying the datasource URL in your
application.properties
file, as shown in the following example:
spring
.
datasource
.
url
=
jdbc
:
postgresql
:
//[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?user=[user]&password=[password]&sslmode=require
Refer to the
Connect with JDBC
section above for information about obtaining connection details for your Neon database.

Connect from Knex to Neon
Learn how to connect to Neon from Knex
Knex is an open-source SQL query builder for Postgres. This guide covers the following topics:
Connect to Neon from Knex
Use connection pooling with Knex
Performance tips
Connect to Neon from Knex
To establish a basic connection from Knex to Neon, perform the following steps:
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.
Update the Knex's initialization in your application to the following:
export
const
client
=
knex
({
client
:
'pg'
,
connection
:
{
connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
}
,
});
Add a
DATABASE_URL
variable to your
.env
file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding
?sslmode=require
to the end of the connection string to ensure a
secure connection
.
Your setting will appear similar to the following:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
Use connection pooling with Knex
Serverless functions can require a large number of database connections as demand increases. If you use serverless functions in your application, we recommend that you use a pooled Neon connection string, as shown:
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL=
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
A pooled Neon connection string adds
-pooler
to the endpoint ID, which tells Neon to use a pooled connection. You can add
-pooler
to your connection string manually or copy a pooled connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Enable the
Connection pooling
toggle to add the
-pooler
suffix.
Performance tips
This section outlines performance optimizations you can try when using Knex with Neon.
Enabling NODE_PG_FORCE_NATIVE
Knex leverages a
node-postgres
Pool instance to connect to your Postgres database. Installing
pg-native
and setting the
NODE_PG_FORCE_NATIVE
environment variable to
true
switches the
pg
driver to
pg-native
, which can produce noticeably faster response times according to some users.
Replacing query parameters
You may be able to achieve better performance with Knex by replacing any parameters you've defined in your queries, as performed by the following function, for example:
// Function to replace query parameters in a query
function
replaceQueryParams
(query
,
values) {
let
replacedQuery
=
query;
values
.forEach
((tmpParameter)
=>
{
if
(
typeof
tmpParameter
===
'string'
) {
replacedQuery
=
replacedQuery
.replace
(
'?'
,
`'
${
tmpParameter
}
'`
);
}
else
{
replacedQuery
=
replacedQuery
.replace
(
'?'
,
tmpParameter);
}
});
return
replacedQuery;
}
// So instead of this
await
client
.raw
(text
,
values);
// Do this to get better performance
await
client
.raw
(
replaceQueryParams
(text
,
values));
You can try this optimization yourself by downloading our
Get started with Knex example
and running
npm run test

Use Neon with Koyeb
Learn how to connect a Neon Postgres database to an application deployed with Koyeb
Koyeb
is a developer-friendly, serverless platform designed to easily deploy reliable and scalable applications globally. Koyeb offers native autoscaling, automatic HTTPS (SSL), auto-healing, and global load-balancing across their edge network with zero configuration.
This guide describes how connect a Neon Postgres database to an application deployed with Koyeb. To follow the instructions in this guide, you require:
A
Koyeb account
to deploy the application. Alternatively, you can install the
Koyeb CLI
if you prefer to deploy the application from your terminal.
A Neon account to deploy the Postgres database. If you do not have one, see
Sign up
.
The example application connects to your Neon Postgres database using
Prisma
as an ORM. Prisma synchronizes the database schema with the Prisma schema included with the application and seeds the database.
Create a Neon project
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select
Create a project
.
Enter a name for the project (
neon-koyeb
, for example), and select a Postgres version and region.
Click
Create project
.
A dialog pops up with your Neon connection string, which appears similar to the following:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Store this value in a safe place. It is required later. The connection string specifies
neondb
as the database. This is the database created with your Neon project if you did not specify a different database name. You will use this database with the example application.
Deploy the application on Koyeb
You can deploy on Koyeb using the control panel or the Koyeb CLI.
From the Koyeb control panel
To deploy the application from the Koyeb
control panel
, follow these steps:
Navigate to the
Apps
tab and select
Create App
.
Select GitHub as the deployment method.
When asked to select the repository to deploy, enter
https://github.com/koyeb/example-express-prisma
in the
Public GitHub repository
field.
Keep
example-express-prisma
as the name and
main
as the branch.
In
Build and deployment settings
, enable the
Override
setting and add the following
Build command
:
npm run postgres:init
Select the region closest to your Neon database.
Under
Advanced
>
Environment variables
, add a
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to enable the application to connect to your Neon Postgres database. Set the value to the Neon connection string provided to you when you created the Neon project.
Enter a name for your app. For example,
express-neon
Click
Deploy
.
Koyeb builds the application. After the build and deployment have finished, you can access your application running on Koyeb by clicking the URL ending with
.koyeb.app
.
The example application exposes a
/planets
endpoint that you can use to list planets from the database. After your deployment is live, you should see the following results when navigating to
https://<YOUR_APP_URL>.koyeb.app/planets
:

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Laravel
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Laravel project
Laravel
is a popular PHP web application framework that provides an expressive and elegant syntax for building web applications. It includes an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) called Eloquent, which allows you to interact with databases using a fluent API. Laravel also provides a powerful migration system to manage database schema changes over time.
This guide demonstrates how to use Laravel with the Neon Postgres database. We'll create a simple Laravel application and walk through the process of setting up the database, defining models, and generating and running migrations to manage schema changes.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
PHP
installed on your local machine. This guide uses PHP 8.1, but you can use any recent version compatible with Laravel.
Composer
installed on your local machine for managing PHP dependencies.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select a project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings, which you can find by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can be prone to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Setting up the Laravel project
Create a new Laravel project
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your Laravel project. Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:
composer
create-project
--prefer-dist
laravel/laravel
guide-neon-laravel
This command creates a new Laravel project named
guide-neon-laravel
in the current directory.
Set up the Database configuration
Open the
.env
file in the project root directory and update the following database connection variables:
DB_CONNECTION
=
pgsql
DB_PORT
=
5432
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
Replace
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
with the connection string you retrieved from the Neon Console earlier. The
DB_CONNECTION
should be set to
pgsql
to indicate that we are using a Postgres database.
Defining data models and running migrations
Specify the data model
Data models are defined using the
Elquent
ORM in Laravel. Our application is a simple catalog of authors and books, where each author can have multiple books. We'll create two models,
Author
and
Book
, to represent the data.
Create a new file
Author.php
in the
app/Models
directory with the following code:
<?
php
namespace
App
\
Models
;
use
Illuminate
\
Database
\
Eloquent
\
Model
;
class
Author
extends
Model
{
protected
$fillable
=
[
'name'
,
'bio'
];
public
function
books
()
{
return
$this
->
hasMany
(
Book
::class
)
;
}
}
Create another file
Book.php
in the
app/Models
directory with the following code:
<?
php
namespace
App
\
Models
;
use
Illuminate
\
Database
\
Eloquent
\
Model
;
class
Book
extends
Model
{
protected
$fillable
=
[
'title'
,
'author_id'
];
public
function
author
()
{
return
$this
->
belongsTo
(
Author
::class
)
;
}
}
The
Author
model represents an author with fields for name and bio. The
Book
model represents a book with fields for title and author (as a foreign key to the
Author
model). Laravel automatically creates an
id
field for each model as the primary key and manages the
created_at
and
updated_at
timestamps.
Generate migration files
To generate migration files for creating the
authors
and
books
tables, run the following commands in the terminal:
php
artisan
make:migration
create_authors_table
php
artisan
make:migration
create_books_table
These commands generate empty migration files in the
database/migrations
directory. Unlike frameworks such as Django, Laravel does not generate the schema automatically based on the model definitions. Instead, you define the schema in the migration files.
Open the
create_authors_table
migration file and update the
up
method to define the table schema:
public
function
up
()
{
Schema
::
create
(
'authors'
,
function
(
Blueprint
$table) {
$table
->
id
()
;
$table
->
string
(
'name'
)
;
$table
->
text
(
'bio'
)
->
nullable
()
;
$table
->
timestamps
()
;
}
)
;
}
Similarly, open the
create_books_table
migration file and update the
up
method:
public
function
up
()
{
Schema
::
create
(
'books'
,
function
(
Blueprint
$table) {
$table
->
id
()
;
$table
->
string
(
'title'
)
;
$table
->
unsignedBigInteger
(
'author_id'
)
;
$table
->
timestamps
()
;
$table
->
foreign
(
'author_id'
)
->
references
(
'id'
)
->
on
(
'authors'
)
->
onDelete
(
'cascade'
)
;
}
)
;
}
Apply the migration
To apply the migration and create the corresponding tables in the Neon Postgres database, run the following command:
php
artisan
migrate
This command executes the migration files and creates the
authors
and
books
tables in the database.
Seed the database
To populate the database with some initial data, we use Laravel's database seeding feature. Open the file
DatabaseSeeder.php
in the
database/seeders
directory and replace its contents with the following code:
<?
php
namespace
Database
\
Seeders
;
use
App
\
Models
\
Author
;
use
App
\
Models
\
Book
;
use
Illuminate
\
Database
\
Seeder
;
class
DatabaseSeeder
extends
Seeder
{
public
function
run
()
:
void
{
$authors
=
[
[
'name'
=>
'J.R.R. Tolkien'
,
'bio'
=>
'The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings.'
,
'books'
=>
[
[
'title'
=>
'The Fellowship of the Ring'
]
,
[
'title'
=>
'The Two Towers'
]
,
[
'title'
=>
'The Return of the King'
]
,
]
,
]
,
[
'name'
=>
'George R.R. Martin'
,
'bio'
=>
'The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.'
,
'books'
=>
[
[
'title'
=>
'A Game of Thrones'
]
,
[
'title'
=>
'A Clash of Kings'
]
,
[
'title'
=>
'A Storm of Swords'
]
,
]
,
]
,
[
'name'
=>
'J.K. Rowling'
,
'bio'
=>
'The creator of the Harry Potter series.'
,
'books'
=>
[
[
'title'
=>
'Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone'
]
,
[
'title'
=>
'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'
]
,
]
,
]
,
];
foreach
($authors
as
$authorData) {
$author
=
Author
::
create
(
[
'name'
=>
$authorData[
'name'
]
,
'bio'
=>
$authorData[
'bio'
]
,
]
)
;
foreach
($authorData[
'books'
]
as
$bookData) {
$author
->
books
()
->
create
(
$bookData
)
;
}
}
}
}
This seeder creates three authors and associates them with their corresponding books. To run this script and populate the database, run the following command in the terminal:
php
artisan
db:seed
Implement the application
Create routes and controllers
We'll create two routes and corresponding controllers to display the authors and books in our application.
Open the
routes/web.php
file and add the following routes:
...
use
App
\
Http
\
Controllers
\
AuthorController
;
use
App
\
Http
\
Controllers
\
BookController
;
...
Route
::
get
(
'/authors'
,
[
AuthorController
::class
,
'index'
]
)
->
name
(
'authors.index'
)
;
Route
::
get
(
'/books/{author}'
,
[
BookController
::class
,
'index'
]
)
->
name
(
'books.index'
)
;
We define two routes:
/authors
to list all authors and
/books/{author}
to list books by a specific author.
Now, create a new file
AuthorController.php
in the
app/Http/Controllers
directory with the following code:
<?
php
namespace
App
\
Http
\
Controllers
;
use
App
\
Models
\
Author
;
class
AuthorController
extends
Controller
{
public
function
index
()
{
$authors
=
Author
::
all
()
;
return
response
()
->
json
(
$authors
)
;
}
}
Similarly, create another file
BookController.php
in the
app/Http/Controllers
directory with the following code:
<?
php
namespace
App
\
Http
\
Controllers
;
use
App
\
Models
\
Author
;
class
BookController
extends
Controller
{
public
function
index
(
Author
$author)
{
$books
=
$author
->
books;
return
response
()
->
json
(
$books
)
;
}
}
These controllers define the
index
action to retrieve all authors and books by a specific author, respectively. The data is returned as JSON responses.
Run the Laravel development server
To start the Laravel development server and test the application, run the following command:
php
artisan
serve
Navigate to the url
http://localhost:8000/authors
in your browser to view the list of authors. You can also view the books by a specific author by visiting
http://localhost:8000/books/{author_id}
.
Applying schema changes
We will demonstrate how to handle schema changes by adding a new field
country
to the
Author
model, which will store the author's country of origin.
Update the data model
Open the
Author.php
file in the
app/Models
directory and add the
country
field to the
$fillable
property:
protected
$fillable
=
[
'name'
,
'bio'
,
'country'
];
Generate and run the migration
To generate a new migration file for the schema change, run the following command:
php
artisan
make:migration
add_country_to_authors_table
This command generates a new migration file in the
database/migrations
directory.
Open the generated migration file and update the
up
method to add the new
country
column:
public
function
up
()
{
Schema
::
table
(
'authors'
,
function
(
Blueprint
$table) {
$table
->
string
(
'country'
)
->
nullable
()
->
after
(
'bio'
)
;
}
)
;
}
Now, to apply the migration, run the following command:
php
artisan
migrate
Test the schema change
Restart the Laravel development server:
php
artisan
serve
Navigate to the url
http://localhost:8000/authors
to view the list of authors. Each author entry now includes the
country
field set to
null
, reflecting the schema change.
Conclusion
In this guide, we demonstrated how to set up a Laravel project with
Neon
Postgres, define database models using Eloquent, generate migrations, and run them. Laravel's Eloquent ORM and migration system make it easy to interact with the database and manage schema evolution over time.

Connect from Laravel to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Laravel application
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Connecting to Neon from Laravel is the same as connecting to a standalone Postgres installation from Laravel. Only the connection details differ.
To connect to Neon from Laravel:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Configure the connection
Open the
.env
file in your Laravel app, and replace all the database credentials.
DB_CONNECTION
=
pgsql
DB_HOST
=
[neon_hostname
]
DB_PORT
=
5432
DB_DATABASE
=
[dbname
]
DB_USERNAME
=
[user
]
DB_PASSWORD
=
[password
]
You can find your database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Connection issues
With older Postgres clients/drivers, including older PDO_PGSQL drivers, you may receive the following error when attempting to connect to Neon:
ERROR:
The
endpoint
ID
is
not
specified.
Either
upgrade
the
Postgres
client
library
(libpq)
for
SNI support or pass the endpoint ID (
the
first
part
of
the
domain
name
) as a parameter:
'&options=endpoint%3D'
. See [https://neon.com/sni](
/sni
) for more information.
If you run into this error, please see the following documentation for an explanation of the issue and workarounds:
The endpoint ID is not specified
.
If using a connection string to connect to your database, try
Workaround A. Pass the endpoint ID as an option
. For example:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?options=endpoint%3D[endpoint-id]
Replace
[endpoint_id]
with your compute's endpoint ID, which you can find in your Neon connection string. It looks similar to this:
ep-cool-darkness-123456
.
If using database connection parameters, as shown above, try
Workaround D. Specify the endpoint ID in the password field
. For example:
DB_PASSWORD=endpoint=<endpoint_id>$<password>

Prepare a Neon database
For demonstration purposes, create a
blog
database in Neon with two tables,
posts
and
authors
.
Open the
Neon Console
.
Select your project.
Select
Databases
from the sidebar and create a database named
blog
. For instructions, see
Create a database
.
Using the
Neon SQL Editor
, add the following tables:
-- Creating the `authors` table
CREATE
TABLE
authors
(
author_id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
first_name
VARCHAR
(
100
),
last_name
VARCHAR
(
100
),
email
VARCHAR
(
255
)
UNIQUE
NOT NULL
,
bio
TEXT
);
-- Creating the `posts` table
CREATE
TABLE
posts
(
post_id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
author_id
INTEGER
REFERENCES
authors(author_id),
title
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
,
content
TEXT
,
published_date
TIMESTAMP
DEFAULT
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Use the selection drop-down menu.
Your Java connection string should look something like the one shown below.
jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog?user
=alex
&
password
=
AbC123dEf
Connect from Liquibase to your Neon database
Create a directory for your Liquibase project. For example:
mkdir
blogdb
Change to your project directory and create a
liquibase.properties
file.
cd
blogdb
touch
liquibase.properties
Open the
liquibase.properties
file in an editor and add entries for a
liquibase changelog file
and your database
url
. We'll call the changelog file
dbchangelog.xml
. You will use this file to define schema changes. For the
url
, specify the Neon connection string you retrieved previously.
changeLogFile:dbchangelog.xml
url:
jdbc:postgresql://ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/blog?user=alex
&
password
=
AbC123dEf
&
sslmode
=
require
Take a snapshot of your database
In this step, you will run the
generateChangelog
command in your project directory to create a changelog file with the current state of your database. We'll call this file
mydatabase_changelog.xml
.
liquibase
--changeLogFile=mydatabase_changelog.xml
generateChangeLog
You’ll get a changelog file for your database that looks something like this:

Create a schema change
Now, you can start making database schema changes by creating
changesets
and adding them to the database changelog file you defined in your
liquibase.properties
file. A changeset is the basic unit of change in Liquibase.
Create the changelog file where you will add your schema changes:
cd
~/blogdb
touch
dbchangelog.xml
Add the following changeset, which adds a
comments
table to your database. Replace
author="alex" id="myIDNumber1234"
with your auther name and id, which you can retrieve from your changelog file, described in the previous step.

Replicate data to Snowflake with Airbyte
Learn how to replicate data from Neon to Snowflake with Airbyte
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations. In this guide, you will learn how to define your Neon Postgres database as a data source in Airbyte so that you can stream data to Snowflake.
Airbyte
is an open-source data integration platform that moves data from a source to a destination system. Airbyte offers a large library of connectors for various data sources and destinations.
Snowflake
is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics platform designed to handle large volumes of data. Snowflake allows businesses to store, process, and analyze data from various sources.
Prerequisites
A source
Neon project
with a database containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you run the following statements from the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client such as
psql
to create a table with sample data:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);

important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Prepare your source Neon database
This section describes how to prepare your source Neon database (the publisher) for replicating data.
Enable logical replication in Neon
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from
replica
to
logical
for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to
logical
, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client such as
psql
:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Create a Postgres role for replication
It's recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon CLI, Console, or API are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role, which has the required
REPLICATION
privilege.
CLI
Console
API
The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see
Neon CLI commands — roles
neon
roles
create
--name
replication_user
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to Postgres role
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Create a replication slot
Airbyte requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.
Airbyte uses the
pgoutput
plugin in Postgres for decoding WAL changes into a logical replication stream. To create a replication slot called
airbyte_slot
that uses the
pgoutput
plugin, run the following command on your database using your replication role:
SELECT
pg_create_logical_replication_slot(
'airbyte_slot'
,
'pgoutput'
);
airbyte_slot
is the name assigned to the replication slot. You will need to provide this name when you set up your Airbyte source.
Create a publication
Perform the following steps for each table you want to replicate data from:
Add the replication identity (the method of distinguishing between rows) for each table you want to replicate:
ALTER
TABLE
<
table_name
>
REPLICA
IDENTITY
DEFAULT
;
In rare cases, if your tables use data types that support
TOAST
or have very large field values, consider using
REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
instead:
ALTER
TABLE
<
table_name
>
REPLICA
IDENTITY
FULL;
Create the Postgres publication. Include all tables you want to replicate as part of the publication:
CREATE
PUBLICATION airbyte_publication
FOR
TABLE
<
tbl1, tbl2, tbl3
>
;
The publication name is customizable. Refer to the
Postgres docs
if you need to add or remove tables from your publication.
note
The Airbyte UI currently allows selecting any table for Change Data Capture (CDC). If a table is selected that is not part of the publication, it will not be replicated even though it is selected. If a table is part of the publication but does not have a replication identity, the replication identity will be created automatically on the first run if the Postgres role you use with Airbyte has the necessary permissions.
Create a Postgres source in Airbyte
From your Airbyte Cloud account, select
Sources
from the left navigation bar, search for
Postgres
, and then create a new Postgres source.
Enter the connection details for your Neon database. You can find your database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
For example, given a connection string like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Enter the details in the Airbyte
Create a source
dialog as shown below. Your values will differ.
Host
: ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
Port
: 5432
Database Name
: dbname
Username
: replication_user
Password
: AbC123dEf
Under
Optional fields
, list the schemas you want to sync. Schema names are case-sensitive, and multiple schemas may be specified. By default,
public
is the only selected schema.
Select an SSL mode. You will most frequently choose
require
or
verify-ca
. Both of these options always require encryption. The
verify-ca
mode requires a certificate. Refer to
Connect securely
for information about the location of certificate files you can use with Neon.
Under
Advanced
:
Select
Read Changes using Write-Ahead Log (CDC)
from available replication methods.
In the
Replication Slot
field, enter the name of the replication slot you created previously:
airbyte_slot
.
In the
Publication
field, enter the name of the publication you created previously:
airbyte_publication
.
Allow inbound traffic
If you are on Airbyte Cloud, and you are using Neon's
IP Allow
feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Airbyte's IP addresses. You can find a list of IPs that need to be allowlisted in the
Airbyte Security docs
. For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see
Configure IP Allow
.
Complete the source setup
To complete your source setup, click
Set up source
in the Airbyte UI. Airbyte will test the connection to your database. Once this succeeds, you've successfully configured an Airbyte Postgres source for your Neon database.
Configure Snowflake as a destination
To complete your data integration setup, you can now add Snowflake as your destination.
Prerequisites
A Snowflake account with the
ACCOUNTADMIN
role. If you're using a company account, you may need to contact your Snowflake administrator to set one up for you.
Set up Airbyte entities in Snowflake
To set up the Snowflake destination connector, you first need to create Airbyte entities in Snowflake (a warehouse, database, schema, user, and role) with the
OWNERSHIP
permission to write data to Snowflake.
You can use the following script in a new
Snowflake worksheet
to create the entities. This script is provided as part of
Airbyte's Snowflake connector setup guide
.
note
If you want, you can edit the script to change the password to a more secure password and to change the names of other resources. If you do rename entities, make sure to follow

This guide describes how to replicate data from AlloyDB Postgres to Neon using native Postgres logical replication. The steps in this guide follow those described in
Set up native PostgreSQL logical replication
, in the
Google AlloyDB documentation
.
Prerequisites
An AlloyDB Postgres instance containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements to create a table with sample data.
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT

Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences.
Prepare your AlloyDB source database
This section describes how to prepare your source AlloyDB Postgres instance (the publisher) for replicating data to Neon.
Enable logical replication
Your first step is to enable logical replication at the source Postgres instance. In AlloyDB, you can enable logical replication by setting the
alloydb.enable_pglogical
and
alloydb.logical_decoding
flags to
on
. This sets the Postgres
wal_level
parameter to
logical
.
To enable these flags:
In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your
AlloyDB Clusters
page.
From the
Actions
menu for your Primary instance, select
Edit
.
Scroll down to the
Advanced Configurations Options
>
Flags
section.
If the flags have not been set on the instance before, click
Add a Database Flag
, and set the value to
on
for the
alloydb.enable_pglogical
and
alloydb.logical_decoding
.
Click
Update instance
to save your changes and confirm your selections.
Afterward, you can verify that logical replication is enabled by running
SHOW wal_level;
from
AlloyDB Studio
or your terminal:
Allow connections from Neon
You need to allow connections to your AlloyDB Postgres instance from Neon. To do this in your AlloyDB instance:
In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your
AlloyDB Clusters
page and select your
Primary instance
to open the
Overview
page.
Scroll down to the
Instances in your cluster
section.
Click
Edit Primary
.
Select the
Enable public IP
checkbox to allow connections over the public internet.
Under
Authorized external networks
, enter the Neon IP addresses you want to allow. Add an entry for each of the NAT gateway IP addresses associated with your Neon project's region. Neon has 3 to 6 IP addresses per region, corresponding to each availability zone. See
NAT Gateway IP addresses
for the IP addresses.
note
AlloyDB requires addresses to be specified in CIDR notation. You can do so by appending
/32
to the NAT Gateway IP address; for example:
18.217.181.229/32
In the example shown below, you can see that three addresses were added in CIDR format by appending
/32
.
Under
Network Security
, select
Require SSL Encryption (default)
if it's not already selected.
Click
Update Instance
when you are finished.
Note your public IP address
Record the public IP address of your AlloyDB Postgres instance. You'll need this value later when you set up a subscription from your Neon database. You can find the public IP address on your AlloyDB instance's
Overview
page, under
Instances in your cluster
>
Connectivity
.
note
If you do not use a public IP address, you'll need to configure access via a private IP. See
Private IP overview
, in the AlloyDB documentation.
Create a Postgres role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data from your AlloyDB Postgres instance. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. On your AlloyDB Postgres instance, login in as your
postgres
user or an administrative user you use to create roles and run the following command to create a replication role. You can replace the name
replication_user
with whatever name you want to use.
CREATE
USER
replication_user
WITH
REPLICATION
IN
ROLE
alloydbsuperuser
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'replication_user_password'
;
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to a Postgres role named
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your source Neon Postgres database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data from your AlloyDB Postgres instance.
Prepare your database schema
When configuring logical replication in Postgres, the tables defined in your publication on the source database you are replicating from must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. You can create the tables manually in your destination database or use utilities like
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
to dump the schema from your source database and load it to your destination database.
note
If you're just using the sample
playing_with_neon
table, you can create the same table on the destination database with the following statement:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
Dump the schema
To dump only the schema from a database, you can run a
pg_dump
command similar to the following to create an
.sql
dump file with the schema only:
pg_dump
--schema-only \
--no-privileges \
"postgresql://role:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
\
>
schema_dump.sql
With the
--schema-only
option, only object definitions are dumped. Data is excluded.
The
--no-privileges
option prevents dumping privileges. Neon may not support the privileges you've defined elsewhere, or if dumping a schema from Neon, there maybe Neon-specific privileges that cannot be restored to another database.
Review and modify the dumped schema
After dumping a schema to an
.sql
file, review it for statements that you don't want to replicate or that won't be supported on your destination database, and comment them out. For example, when dumping a schema from AlloyDB, you'll see the statements shown below, which you'll need to comment out because they won't be supported in Neon. Generally, you should remove any parameters configured on another Postgres provider and rely on Neon's default Postgres settings.
If you are replicating a large dataset, also consider removing any
CREATE INDEX
statements from the resulting dump file to avoid creating indexes when loading the schema on the destination database (the subscriber). Taking indexes out of the equation can substantially reduce the time required for initial data load performed when starting logical replication. Save the
CREATE INDEX
statements that you remove. You can add the indexes back after the initial data copy is completed.
note
To comment out a single line, you can use
--
at the beginning of the line.
-- SET statement_timeout = 0;
-- SET lock_timeout = 0;
-- SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0;
-- SET client_encoding = 'UTF8';
-- SET standard_conforming_strings = on;
-- SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);
-- SET check_function_bodies = false;
-- SET xmloption = content;
-- SET client_min_messages = warning;
-- SET row_security = off;
-- ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO alloydbsuperuser;
-- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS google_columnar_engine WITH SCHEMA public;
-- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS google_db_advisor WITH SCHEMA public;
Load the schema
After making any necessary modifications to the dump file, load the dumped schema using
pg_restore
.
tip
When you're restoring on Neon, you can input your Neon connection string in place of
postgresql://role:password@hostname:5432/dbname
. You can find your database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
psql \
"postgresql://role:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
\
<
schema_dump.sql
After you've loaded the schema, you can view the result with this
psql
command:
\dt
Create a subscription
After creating a publication on the source database, you need to create a subscription on your Neon destination database.
Create the subscription using the using a
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement:
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'host=<primary-ip> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=replication_user password=replication_user_password'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
subscription_name
: A name you chose for the subscription.
connection_string
: The connection string for the source AlloyDB database where you defined the publication. For the
<primary_ip>
, use the IP address of your AlloyDB Postgres instance that you noted earlier, and specify the name and password of your replication role. If you're replicating from a database other than
postgres
, be sure to specify that database name.
publication_name
: The name of the publication you created on the source Neon database.
Verify the subscription was created by running the following command:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
The subscription (
my_subscription
) should be listed, confirming that your subscription has been created successfully.
Test the replication
Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber database.
Run some data modifying queries on the source database (inserts, updates, or deletes). If you're using the
playing_with_neon
database, you can use this statement to insert 10 rows:
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
Perform a row count on the source and destination databases to make sure the result matches.
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
playing_with_neon;
count
-------
30
(
1
row
)
Alternatively, you can run the following query on the subscriber to make sure the
last_msg_receipt_time
is as expected. For example, if you just ran an insert option on the publisher, the
last_msg_receipt_time
should reflect the time of that operation.
SELECT
subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM
pg_catalog.pg_stat_subscription;
Switch over your application
After the replication operation is complete, you can switch your application over to the destination database by swapping out your AlloyDB source database connection details for your Neon destination database connection details.
You can find your Neon database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For details, see
Connect from any application

Replicate data from Aurora PostgreSQL
Learn how to replicate data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Neon
New feature
If you are looking to migrate your database to Neon, you may want to try our new
Migration Assistant
, which can help. Read the
guide
to learn more.
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Neon.
Prerequisites
A source database in Aurora PostgreSQL containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements to create a table with sample data:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
A Neon project with a Postgres database to receive the replicated data. For information about creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences
Prepare your source database
This section describes how to prepare your source Aurora Postgres instance (the publisher) for replicating data to Neon.
Enable logical replication in the source Aurora PostgreSQL instance
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the Amazon RDS console at
https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/
.
From the navigation pane, select your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
Go to the
Configuration
tab. Locate the
DB cluster parameter group
link.
note
If you are using the default parameter group, you will need to create a custom parameter group to set the value. You can do so by selecting
Parameter groups
>
Create parameter group
from the sidebar, selecting
Aurora PostgreSQL
as the engine type, and filling in the required fields. When you're finished, navigate back to your Aurora instance page, click
Modify
, and scroll down to select your new parameter group. Click
Continue
, and select
Apply immediately
to make the change, then click
Modify DB instance
.
Click on the link to view the custom parameters for your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
In the parameters search bar, type
rds
to locate the
rds.logical_replication
parameter. This parameter is set to
0
by default, meaning it is turned off.
To enable this feature, click on
Edit
, and select
1
from the drop-down menu.
Click
Save Changes
.
Reboot the
Writer instance
of your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster to apply the changes. In the Amazon RDS console, select your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, then select the
Writer instance
of the cluster and choose
Reboot
from the
Actions
menu.
Once the instance is available again, you can verify that logical replication is enabled as follows:
Use
psql
to connect to the writer instance of your Aurora PostreSQL DB cluster.
psql
--host=your-db-cluster-instance-1.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com
--port=5432
--username=postgres
--password
--dbname=postgres
Verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following command:
SHOW
rds.logical_replication
;
rds.logical_replication
-------------------------
on
(
1
row
)
Also, confirm that the
wal_level
is set to logical:
SHOW
wal_level
;
wal_level
-----------
logical
(
1
row
)
Allow connections from Neon
You need to allow inbound connections to your Aurora Postgres instance from Neon. You can do this by editing your writer instance's
CIDR/IP - Inbound
security group, which you can find a link to from the
Connectivity & security
tab on your database instance page.
Click on the security group name.
Click on the security group ID.
From the
Actions
menu, select
Edit inbound rules
.
Add rules that allow traffic from each of the IP addresses for your Neon project's region.
Neon uses 3 to 6 IP addresses per region for outbound communication, corresponding to each availability zone in the region. See
NAT Gateway IP addresses
for Neon's NAT gateway IP addresses.
When you're finished, click
Save rules
.
note
You can specify a rule for
0.0.0.0/0
to allow traffic from any IP address. However, this configuration is not considered secure.
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Prepare your destination database
This section describes how to prepare your source Neon Postgres database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data from your Aurora Postgres instance.
Prepare your database schema
When configuring logical replication in Postgres, the tables defined in your publication on the source database you are replicating from must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. You can create the tables manually in your destination database or use utilities like
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
to dump the schema from your source database and load it to your destination database. See
Import a database schema
for instructions.
If you're using the sample
playing_with_neon
table, you can create the same table on the destination database with the following statement:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
Create a subscription
After creating a publication on the source database, you need to create a subscription on your Neon destination database.
Use the
Neon SQL Editor
,
psql
, or another SQL client to connect to your destination database.
Create the subscription using a
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement.
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'postgresql://postgres:password@database-1.czmwaio8k05k.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com/postgres'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
subscription_name
: A name you chose for the subscription.
connection_string
: The connection string for the source AWS Aurora Postgres database where you defined the publication.
publication_name
: The name of the publication you created on the source Aurora Postgres database.
Verify the subscription was created by running the following command:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
subid |     subname     | pid | leader_pid | relid | received_lsn |      last_msg_send_time       |     last_msg_receipt_time     | latest_end_lsn |        latest_end_time

Replicate data from Cloud SQL Postgres
Learn how to replicate data from Google Cloud SQL Postgres to Neon
This guide describes how to replicate data from Cloud SQL Postgres using native Postgres logical replication, as described in
Set up native PostgreSQL logical replication
, in the Google Cloud SQL documentation.
Prerequisites
A Cloud SQL Postgres instance containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements to create a table with sample data. Your database and schema may differ.
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,

A Neon project with a Postgres database to receive the replicated data. For information about creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences.
Prepare your Cloud SQL source database
This section describes how to prepare your source Cloud SQL Postgres instance (the publisher) for replicating data to Neon.
Enable logical replication
The first step is to enable logical replication at the source Postgres instance. In Cloud SQL, you can enable logical replication for your Postgres instance by setting the
cloudsql.logical_decoding
flag to
on
. This action will set the Postgres
wal_level
parameter to
logical
.
To enable this flag:
In the Google Cloud console, select the project that contains the Cloud SQL instance for which you want to set a database flag.
Open the instance and click
Edit
.
Scroll down to the
Flags
section.
If this flag has not been set on the instance before, click
Add item
, choose the flag from the drop-down menu, and set its value to
On
.
Click
Save
to save your changes.
Confirm your changes under
Flags
on the
Overview
page.
The change requires restarting the instance:
Afterward, you can verify that logical replication is enabled by running
SHOW wal_level;
from
Cloud SQL Studio
or your terminal.
Allow connections from Neon
You need to allow connections to your Cloud SQL Postgres instance from Neon. To do this in Google Cloud:
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
Open the
Overview
page of your instance by clicking the instance name.
From the SQL navigation menu, select
Connections
.
Click the
Networking
tab.
Select the
Public IP
checkbox.
Click
Add network
.
Optionally, in the
Name
field, enter a name for this network.
In the
Network
field, enter the IP address from which you want to allow connections. You will need to perform this step for each of the NAT gateway IP addresses associated with your Neon project's region. Neon uses 3 to 6 IP addresses per region for this outbound communication, corresponding to each availability zone in the region. See
NAT Gateway IP addresses
for Neon's NAT gateway IP addresses.
note
Cloud SQL requires addresses to be specified in CIDR notation. You can do so by appending
/32
to the NAT Gateway IP address; for example:
18.217.181.229/32
In the example shown below, you can see that three addresses were added, named
Neon1
,
Neon2
, and
Neon3
. You can name them whatever you like. The addresses were added in CIDR format by adding
/32
.
Click
Done
after adding a Network entry.
Click
Save
when you are finished adding Network entries for all of your Neon project's NAT Gateway IP addresses.
note
You can specify a single Network entry using
0.0.0.0/0
to allow traffic from any IP address. However, this configuration is not considered secure and will trigger a warning.
Note your public IP address
Record the public IP address of your Cloud SQL Postgres instance. You'll need this value later when you set up a subscription from your Neon database. You can find the public IP address on your Cloud SQL instance's
Overview
page.
note
If you do not use a public IP address, you'll need to configure access via a private IP. Refer to the
Cloud SQL documentation
.
Create a Postgres role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data from your Cloud SQL Postgres instance. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. On your Cloud SQL Postgres instance, login in as your
postgres
user or an administrative user you use to create roles and run the following command to create a replication role. You can replace the name
replication_user
with whatever role name you want to use.
CREATE
USER
replication_user
WITH
REPLICATION
IN
ROLE
cloudsqlsuperuser
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'replication_user_password'
;
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to a Postgres role named
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your source Neon Postgres database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data from your Cloud SQL Postgres instance.
Prepare your database schema
When configuring logical replication in Postgres, the tables in the source database you are replicating from must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. You can create the tables manually in your destination database or use utilities like
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
to dump the schema from your source database and load it to your destination database. See
Import a database schema
for instructions.
If you're using the sample
playing_with_neon
table, you can create the same table on the destination database with the following statement:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
Create a subscription
After creating a publication on the source database, you need to create a subscription on your Neon destination database.
Create the subscription using the using a
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement.
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'host=<primary-ip> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=replication_user password=replication_user_password'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
subscription_name
: A name you chose for the subscription.
connection_string
: The connection string for the source Cloud SQL database where you defined the publication. For the
<primary_ip>
, use the IP address of your Cloud SQL Postgres instance that you noted earlier, and specify the name and password of your replication role. If you're replicating from a database other than
postgres
, be sure to specify that database name.
publication_name
: The name of the publication you created on the source Neon database.
Verify the subscription was created by running the following command:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
The subscription (
my_subscription
) should be listed, confirming that your subscription has been created successfully.
Test the replication
Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber database.
Run some data modifying queries on the source database (inserts, updates, or deletes). If you're using the
playing_with_neon

SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
Perform a row count on the source and destination databases to make sure the result matches.
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
playing_with_neon;
count
-------
30
(
1
row
)
Alternatively, you can run the following query on the subscriber to make sure the
last_msg_receipt_time
is as expected. For example, if you just ran an insert option on the publisher, the
last_msg_receipt_time
should reflect the time of that operation.
SELECT
subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM
pg_catalog.pg_stat_subscription;
Switch over your application
After the replication operation is complete, you can switch your application over to the destination database by swapping out your Cloud SQL source database connection details for your Neon destination database connection details.
You can find your Neon database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For details, see
Connect from any application

Replicate data with Decodable
Learn how to replicate data from Neon with Decodable
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.
Decodable
is a fully managed platform for ETL, ELT, and stream processing,
powered by Apache Flink® and Debezium.
In this guide, you will learn how to configure a Postgres source connector in Decodable for ingesting changes from your Neon database so that you can replicate data from Neon to any of Decodable's
supported data sinks
, optionally processing the data with SQL or custom Flink jobs.
Prerequisites
A
Decodable account
(
start free
, no credit card required)
A
Neon account
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Enable logical replication in Neon
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from
replica
to
logical
for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to
logical
, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Create a Postgres role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon CLI, Console, or API are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role, which has the required
REPLICATION
privilege.
CLI
Console
API
The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see
Neon CLI commands — roles
neon
roles
create
--name
replication_user
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to Postgres role
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Create a publication
For each table you would like to ingest into Decodable, set its
replica identity
to
FULL
.
To do so, issue the following statement in the
Neon SQL Editor
:
ALTER
TABLE
<
tbl1
>
REPLICA
IDENTITY
FULL;
Next, create a
publication
with the name
dbz_publication
. Include all the tables you would like to ingest into Decodable.
CREATE
PUBLICATION dbz_publication
FOR
TABLE
<
tbl1, tbl2, tbl3
>>
;
Refer to the
Postgres docs
if you need to add or remove tables from your publication.
Upon start-up, the Decodable connector for Postgres will automatically create the
replication slot
required for ingesting data change events from Postgres.
The slot's name will be prefixed with
decodable_
, followed by a unique identifier.
Allow inbound traffic
If you are using Neon's
IP Allow
feature to limit the IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Decodable's IP addresses.
Refer to the
Decodable documentation
for the list of IPs that need to be allowlisted for the Decodable region of your account.
For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see
Configure IP Allow
.
Create a Postgres source connector in Decodable
In the Decodable web UI, select
Connections
from the left navigation bar and click
New Connection
.
In the connector catalog, choose
Postgres CDC
and click
Connect
.
Enter the connection details for your Neon database. You can find your Neon database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Your connection string will look like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Enter the details for
your connection string
into the source connector fields. Based on the sample connection string above, the values would be specified as shown below. Your values will differ.
Connection Type
: Source (the default)
Host
: ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
Port
: 5432
Database
: dbname
Username
: alex
Password
: Click
Add a new secret...
, then specify a name for that secret and
AbC123dEf
as its value
Decoding Plugin Name
: pgoutput (the default)
Click
Next
. Decodable will now scan the source database for all the tables that can be replicated. Select one or more table(s) by checking the
Sync
box next to their name. Optionally, you can change the name of the destination stream for each table, which by default will be in the form of
<database name>__<schema name>__<table_name>
. You can also take a look a the schema of each stream by clicking
View Schema
.
Click
Next
and specify a name for your connection, for instance:
neon-source
.
Click
Create and start
. The default start options in the following dialog don't require any changes, so click
Start
to launch the connector.
Previewing the data
Once the connector is in
Running
state, navigate to the connected Decodable stream, via
Outbound to...
on the connector's overview tab.
By clicking
Run Preview
, you can examine the change events ingested by the connector.
Next steps
At this point, you have a running connector, which continuously ingests changes from a Neon database into Decodable with low latency.
Next, you could set up one of the supported Decodable
sink connectors
which will propagate the data to a wide range of data stores and systems, such as Snowflake, Elasticsearch, Apache Kafka, Apache Iceberg, Amazon S3, any many more.
If needed, you also can add a
processing step
, either using SQL or by deploying your own Apache Flink job,
for instance, to filter and transform the data before propagating it to an external system.
Of course, you also can take your processed data back to another Neon database, using the Decodable sink connector for Postgres.

Replicate data with Fivetran
Learn how to replicate data from Neon with Fivetran
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.
Fivetran
is an automated data movement platform that helps you centralize data from disparate sources, which you can then manage directly from your browser. Fivetran extracts your data and loads it into your data destination.
In this guide, you will learn how to define a Neon Postgres database as a data source in Fivetran so that you can replicate data to one or more of Fivetran's supported destinations.

;
The publication name is customizable. Refer to the
Postgres docs
if you need to add or remove tables from your publication.
Create a replication slot
Fivetran requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.
Fivetran uses the
pgoutput
plugin in Postgres for decoding WAL changes into a logical replication stream. To create a replication slot called
fivetran_slot
that uses the
pgoutput
plugin, run the following command on your database using your replication role:
SELECT
pg_create_logical_replication_slot(
'fivetran_pgoutput_slot'
,
'pgoutput'
);
The name assigned to the replication slot is
fivetran_pgoutput_slot
. You will need to provide this name when you set up your Fivetran source.
Create a Postgres source in Fivetran
Log in to your
Fivetran
account.
On the
Select your datasource
page, search for the

fivetran_pgoutput_slot
and
fivetran_pub
, respectively).
If you are using Neon's
IP Allow
feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, add Fivetran's IPs to your allowlist in Neon.

Get started with logical replication
Learn how to replicate data to and from your Neon Postgres database
Neon's logical replication feature, available to all Neon users, allows you to replicate data to and from your Neon Postgres database:
Stream data from your Neon database to external destinations, enabling Change Data Capture (CDC) and real-time analytics. External sources might include data warehouses, analytical database services, real-time stream processing systems, messaging and event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases, among others. See
Replicate data from Neon
.
Perform live migrations to Neon from external sources such as AWS RDS, Aurora, and Google Cloud SQL — or any platform that runs Postgres. See
Replicate data to Neon
.
Replicate data from one Neon project to another for Neon project, account, Postgres version, or region migration. See
Replicate data from one Neon project to another
.
Logical replication in Neon works like it does on any standard Postgres installation. It uses a publisher-subscriber model to replicate data from the source database to the destination database. Neon can act as a publisher or subscriber.
Replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the publisher to the subscriber. Once this is done, subsequent changes are sent to the subscriber as they occur in real-time.

Replicate data with Inngest
Learn how to replicate data from Neon with Inngest
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.
Inngest
is a durable workflow platform that allows you to trigger workflow based on Neon database changes. With its native Neon integration, it is the easiest way to set up data replication with custom transformations or 3rd party API destinations (ex, Neon to Amplitude, Neon to S3).
In this guide, you will learn how to configure your Inngest account for ingesting changes from your Neon database, enabling you to replicate data from Neon to Inngest workflows.
Prerequisites
A
Inngest account
A
Neon account
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Enabling Logical Replication on your database
The Inngest Integration relies on Neon’s Logical Replication feature to get notified upon database changes.
Navigate to your Neon Project using the Neon Console and open the
Settings
>
Logical Replication
page. From here, follow the instructions to enable Logical Replication:
Configuring the Inngest integration
Your Neon database is now ready to work with Inngest.
To configure the Inngest Neon Integration, navigate to the Inngest Platform, open the
Integrations page
, and follow the instructions of the
Neon Integration installation wizard
:
The Inngest Integration requires Postgres admin credentials to complete its setup.
These credentials are not stored and are only used during the installation process
.
You can find your admin Neon database connection credentials by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For details, see
Connect from any application
.
Example: Replicating data to Amplitude
The below example demonstrates how to replicate new
users
table rows to Amplitude using Amplitude's API.
Once the Inngest integration is installed, a flow of
"db/*"
events will be created when updates are made to your database.
For example, if you create a new user in your database, a
"db/users.updated"
event
will be created:
{
"name"
:
"db/users.updated"
,
"data"
:
{
"new"
:
{
"id"
:
{
"data"
:
2
,
"encoding"
:
"i"
}
,
"name"
:
{
"data"
:
"Charly"
,
"encoding"
:
"t"
}
,
"email"
:
{
"data"
:
"charly@inngest.com"
,
"encoding"
:
"t"
}
}
,
"table"
:
"users"
,
"txn_commit_time"
:
"2024-09-24T14:41:19.75149Z"
,
"txn_id"
:
36530520
}
,
"ts"
:
1727146545006
}
Such events can be used to trigger Inngest functions to transform and replicate data to external destinations like Amplitude:
// inngest/functions/users-replication.ts
import
{ inngest }
from
'./client'
;
export
const
updateAmplitudeUserMapping
=
inngest
.createFunction
(
{ id
:
'update-amplitude-user-mapping'
}
,
{ event
:
'db/users.updated'
}
,
async
({ event
,
step })
=>
{
// Extract the user data from the event
const
{
data
}
=
event;
const
{
id
,
email
}

Replicate data with Kafka (Confluent) and Debezium
Learn how to replicate data from Neon with Kafka (Confluent) and Debezium
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.
Confluent Cloud is a fully managed, cloud-native real-time data streaming service, built on Apache Kafka. It allows you to stream data from various sources, including Postgres, and build apps that consume messages from an Apache Kafka cluster.
In this guide, you will learn how to stream data from a Neon Postgres database to a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud. You will use the
PostgreSQL CDC Source Connector (Debezium) for Confluent Cloud
to read Change Data Capture (CDC) events from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) of your Neon database in real-time. The connector will write events to a Kafka stream and auto-generate a Kafka topic. The connector performs an initial snapshot of the table and then streams any future change events.
note
Confluent Cloud Connectors can be set up using the
Confluent Cloud UI
or the
Confluent command-line interface (CLI)
. This guide uses the Confluent Cloud UI.
Prerequisites
A
Confluent Cloud
account
A
Neon account
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Enable logical replication in Neon
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from
replica
to
logical
for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to
logical
, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, which means that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Create a publication
In this example, we'll create a publication for a
users
table in the
public
schema of your Neon database.
Create the
users
table in your Neon database. You can do this via the
Neon SQL Editor
or by connecting to your Neon database from an SQL client such as
psql
.
CREATE
TABLE
users
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
username
VARCHAR
(
50
)
NOT NULL
,
email
VARCHAR
(
100
)
NOT NULL
);
Create a publication for the
users
table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION users_publication
FOR
TABLE
users;
This command creates a publication, named
users_publication
, which will include all changes to the
users
table in your replication stream.
Create a Postgres role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon CLI, Console, or API are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role, which has the required
REPLICATION
privilege.
CLI
Console
API
The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see
Neon CLI commands — roles
neon
roles
create
--name
replication_user
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to Postgres role
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Create a replication slot
The Debezium connector requires a dedicated replication slot. Only one source should be configured to use this replication slot.
To create a replication slot called
debezium
, run the following command on your database using your replication role:
SELECT
pg_create_logical_replication_slot(
'debezium'
,
'pgoutput'
);
debezium
is the name assigned to the replication slot. You will need to provide the slot name when you set up your source connector in Confluent.
pgoutput
is the logical decoder plugin used in this example. Neon supports both
pgoutput
and
wal2json
decoder plugins.
Set up a Kafka cluster in Confluent Cloud
Sign in to Confluent Cloud at
https://confluent.cloud
.
Click
Add cluster
.
On the
Create cluster
page, for the
Basic cluster
, select
Begin configuration
.
On the
Region/zones
page, choose a cloud provider, a region, and select a single availability zone.
Select
Continue
.
Specify your payment details. You can select
Skip payment
for now if you're just trying out the setup.
Specify a cluster name, review the configuration and cost information, and select
Launch cluster
. In this example, we use
cluster_neon
as the cluster name.
It may take a few minutes to provision your cluster. After the cluster has been provisioned, the
Cluster Overview
page displays.
Set up a source connector
To set up a Postgres CDC source connector for Confluent Cloud:
On the
Cluster Overview
page, under
Set up connector
, select
Get started
.
On the
Connector Plugins
page, enter
Postgres
into the search field.
Select the
Postgres CDC Source
connector. This is the
PostgreSQL CDC Source Connector (Debezium) for Confluent Cloud
. This connector will take a snapshot of the existing data and then monitor and record all subsequent row-level changes to that data.
On the
Add Postgres CDC Source connector
page:
Select the type of access you want to grant the connector. For the purpose of this guide, we'll select
Global access
, but if you are configuring a production pipeline, Confluent recommends
Granular access
.
Click the
Generate API key & download
button to generate an API key and secret that your connector can use to communicate with your Kafka cluster. Your applications will need this API key and secret to make requests to your Kafka cluster. Store the API key and secret somewhere safe. This is the only time you’ll see the secret.
Click
Continue
.
On the
Add Postgres CDC Source connector
page:
Add the connection details for your Neon database. You can find your admin Neon database connection credentials by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. Your connection string will look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
Enter the details for
your connection string
into the source connector fields. Based on the sample connection string above, the values would be specified as shown below. Your values will differ.
Database name
:
dbname
Database server name
:
neon_server
(This is a user-specified value that will represent the logical name of your Postgres server. Confluent uses this name as a namespace in all Kafka topic and schema names. It is also used for Avro schema namespaces if the Avro data format is used. The Kafka topic will be created with the prefix
database.server.name
. Only alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and dots are allowed.)
SSL mode
:
require
Database hostname
ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
(this example shows the portion of a Neon connection string forms the database hostname)
Database port
:
5432
(Neon uses port
5432
)
Database username
:
alex
Database Password
AbC123dEf
If you use Neon's
IP Allow
feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to add the Confluent cluster static IP addresses to your allowlist. For information about configuring allowed IPs in Neon, see
Configure IP Allow
. If you do not use Neon's
IP Allow
feature, you can skip this step.
Click
Continue
.
Under
Output Kafka record value format
, select an output format for Kafka record values. The default is
JSON
, so we'll use that format in this guide. Other supported values include
AVRO
,
JSON_SR
, and
PROTOBUF
, which are schema-based message formats. If you use any of these, you must also configure a
Confluent Cloud Schema Registry
.
Expand the
Show advanced configurations
drop-down and set the following values:
Under
Advanced configuration
Ensure
Slot name
is set to
debezium
. This is the name of the replication slot you created earlier.
Set the
Publication name
to
users_publication
, which is the name of the publication you created earlier.
Set
Publication auto-create
mode to
disabled
. You've already created your publication.
Under
Database details
, set
Tables included
to
public.users
, which is the name of the Neon database table you are replicating from.
Click
Continue
.
For
Connector sizing
, accept the default for the maximum number of
Tasks
. Tasks can be scaled up at a later time for additional throughput capacity.
Click
Continue
.
Adjust your
Connector name
if desired, and review your
Connector configuration
, which is provided in
JSON

Click
Continue
to provision the connector, which may take a few monents to complete.
Verify your Kafka stream
To verify that events are now being published to a Kafka stream in Confluent:
Insert a row into your
users
table from the Neon SQL Editor or a
psql
client connect to your Neon database. For example:
-- Insert a new user
INSERT INTO
users (username, email)
VALUES
(
'Zhang'
,
'zhang@example.com'
);
In Confluent Cloud, navigate to your cluster (
cluster_neon
in this guide) and select
Topics
>
neon_server.public.users
>
Messages
. Your newly inserted data should appear at the top of the list of messages.
Next steps
With events now being published to a Kafka stream, you can now set up a connection between Confluent and a supported consumer. This is quite simple using a Confluent Connector. For example, you can stream data to
Databricks
,
Snowflake
, or one of the other supported consumers. Refer to the Confluent documentation for connector-specific instructions.

Replicate data to Materialize
Learn how to replicate data from Neon to Materialize
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from your Neon Postgres database to external destinations.
Materialize
is a data warehouse for operational workloads, purpose-built for low-latency applications. You can use it to process data at speeds and scales not possible in traditional databases, but without the cost, complexity, or development time of most streaming engines.
In this guide, you will learn how to stream data from your Neon Postgres database to Materialize using the Materialize
PostgreSQL source
.
Prerequisites
A
Materialize account
.
A
Neon account
.
Optionally, you can install the
psql
command line utility for running commands in both Neon and Materialize. Alternatively, you can run commands from the
Neon SQL Editor
and Materialize
SQL Shell
, which require no installation or setup.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
Enable logical replication
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from
replica
to
logical
for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to
logical
, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Create a publication
After logical replication is enabled in Neon, the next step is to create a publication for the tables that you want to replicate to Materialize.
From a
psql
client connected to your Neon database or from the
Neon SQL Editor
, set the
replica identity
to
FULL
for each table that you want to replicate to Materialize:
ALTER
TABLE
<
table1
>
REPLICA
IDENTITY
FULL;
REPLICA IDENTITY FULL
ensures that the replication stream includes the previous data of changed rows, in the case of
UPDATE
and
DELETE
operations. This setting allows Materialize to ingest Postgres data with minimal in-memory state.
Create a
publication
with the tables you want to replicate:
For specific tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION mz_source
FOR
TABLE
<
tbl1, tbl2, tbl3
>
;
The
mz_source
publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables and will later be used to ingest the replication stream.
Be sure to include only the tables you need. If the publication includes additional tables, Materialize wastes resources on ingesting and then immediately discarding the data from those tables.
Create a Postgres role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. The default Postgres role created with your Neon project and roles created using the Neon CLI, Console, or API are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role, which has the required
REPLICATION
privilege.
CLI
Console
API
The following CLI command creates a role. To view the CLI documentation for this command, see
Neon CLI commands — roles
neon
roles
create
--name
replication_user
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to Postgres role
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Allow inbound traffic
If you use Neon's
IP Allow
feature to limit IP addresses that can connect to Neon, you will need to allow inbound traffic from Materize IP addresses. If you are currently not limiting IP address access in Neon, you can skip this step.
From a
psql
client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize
SQL Shell
, run this command to find the static egress IP addresses for the Materialize region you are running in:
SELECT
*
FROM
mz_egress_ips;
In your Neon project, add the IPs to your
IP Allow
list, which you can find in your project's settings. For instructions, see
Configure IP Allow
.
Create an ingestion cluster
In Materialize, a
cluster
is an isolated environment, similar to a virtual warehouse in Snowflake. When you create a cluster, you choose the size of its compute resource allocation based on the work you need the cluster to do, whether ingesting data from a source, computing always-up-to-date query results, serving results to clients, or a combination.
In this case, you’ll create 1 new cluster containing 1 medium replica for ingesting source data from your Neon Postgres database.
From a
psql
client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize
SQL Shell
, run the
CREATE CLUSTER
command to create the new cluster:
CREATE
CLUSTER ingest_postgres
SIZE
=
'medium'
;
Materialize recommends starting with a medium
size
replica or larger. This helps Materialize quickly process the initial snapshot of the tables in your publication. Once the snapshot is finished, you can right-size the cluster.
Start ingesting data
Now that you’ve configured your database network and created an ingestion cluster, you can connect Materialize to your Neon Postgres database and start ingesting data.
From a
psql
client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize
SQL Shell
, use the
CREATE SECRET
command to securely store the password for the Postgres role you created earlier:
CREATE
SECRET
pgpass
AS
'<PASSWORD>'
;
You can access the password for your Neon Postgres role from the to open
Connect to your database
modal — click the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the modal.
Use the
CREATE CONNECTION
command to create a connection object with access and authentication details for Materialize to use:
CREATE
CONNECTION
pg_connection
TO
POSTGRES (
HOST
'<host>'
,
PORT
5432
,
USER
'<role_name>'
,
PASSWORD
SECRET
pgpass,
SSL
MODE
'require'
,
DATABASE
'<database>'
);
You can find the connection details for your replication role in the
Connect to your database
modal on your
Project Dashboard
— click the
Connect
button. A Neon connection string looks like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require
Replace
<host>
with your Neon hostname (e.g.,
ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
)
Replace
<role_name>
with the name of your Postgres role (e.g.,
alex
)
Replace
<database>
with the name of the database containing the tables you want to replicate to Materialize (e.g.,
dbname
)
Use the
CREATE SOURCE
command to connect Materialize to your Neon Postgres database and start ingesting data from the publication you created earlier:
CREATE
SOURCE mz_source
IN
CLUSTER ingest_postgres
FROM
POSTGRES
CONNECTION
pg_connection (PUBLICATION
'mz_source'
)
FOR
TABLES
<
table1
>
,
<
table2
>
;
Tips
To ingest data from specific schemas, you can use
FOR SCHEMAS (<schema1>,<schema2>)
.
After creating a source, you can incorporate upstream schema changes for specific replicated tables using the
ALTER SOURCE...{ADD | DROP} SUBSOURCE
syntax.
Check the ingestion status
Before Materialize starts consuming a replication stream, it takes a snapshot of the tables in your publication. Until this snapshot is complete, Materialize won’t have the same view of your data as your Postgres database.
In this step, you’ll verify that the source is running and then check the status of the snapshotting process.
From a
psql
client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize
SQL Shell
, use the
mz_source_statuses
table to check the overall status of your source:
WITH
source_ids
AS
(
SELECT
id
FROM
mz_sources
WHERE
name
=
'mz_source'
)
SELECT
*
FROM
mz_internal.mz_source_statuses
JOIN
(
SELECT
referenced_object_id
FROM
mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
WHERE
object_id
IN
(
SELECT
id
FROM
source_ids)
UNION
SELECT
id
FROM
source_ids
)
AS
sources
ON
mz_source_statuses.id
=
sources.referenced_object_id;
For each subsource, make sure the status is running. If you see stalled or failed, there’s likely a configuration issue for you to fix. Check the error field for details and fix the issue before moving on. If the status of any subsource is starting for more than a few minutes, contact
Materialize support
.
Once the source is running, use the
mz_source_statistics
table to check the status of the initial snapshot:
WITH
source_ids
AS
(
SELECT
id
FROM
mz_sources
WHERE
name
=
'mz_source'
)
SELECT
sources.object_id, bool_and(snapshot_committed)
AS
snapshot_committed
FROM
mz_internal.mz_source_statistics
JOIN
(
SELECT
object_id, referenced_object_id
FROM
mz_internal.mz_object_dependencies
WHERE
object_id
IN
(
SELECT
id
FROM
source_ids)
UNION
SELECT
id, id
FROM
source_ids
)
AS
sources
ON
mz_source_statistics.id
=
sources.referenced_object_id
GROUP BY
sources.object_id;
object_id | snapshot_committed
----------|------------------
u144     | t
(
1
row
)
Once
snapshot_commited
is
t
, move on to the next step. Snapshotting can take between a few minutes to several hours, depending on the size of your dataset and the size of the cluster replica you chose for your
ingest_postgres
cluster.
Right-size the cluster
After the snapshotting phase, Materialize starts ingesting change events from the Postgres replication stream. For this work, Materialize generally performs well with an
xsmall
replica, so you can resize the cluster accordingly.
From a
psql
client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize
SQL Shell
, use the
ALTER CLUSTER
command to downsize the cluster to
xsmall
:
ALTER
CLUSTER ingest_postgres
SET
(
SIZE
'xsmall'
);
Behind the scenes, this command adds a new
xsmall
replica and removes the
medium
replica.
Use the
SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS
command to check the status of the new replica:
SHOW CLUSTER REPLICAS
WHERE
cluster
=
'ingest_postgres'
;
cluster     |
replica
|
size
| ready
-----------------+---------+--------+-------
ingest_postgres | r1      | xsmall | t
(
1
row
)
Going forward, you can verify that your new replica size is sufficient as follows:
a. From a
psql
client connected to Materialize or from the Materialize
SQL Shell
, get the replication slot name associated with your Postgres source from the
mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources
table:
SELECT
d.name
AS
database_name
,
n.name
AS
schema_name,
s.name
AS
source_name,
pgs.replication_slot
FROM
mz_sources
AS
s
JOIN
mz_internal.mz_postgres_sources
AS
pgs
ON
s.id
=
pgs.id
JOIN
mz_schemas

Replicate data from one Neon project to another
Replicate data to a different Neon project for cross-region replication, version migration, or region migration
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from one Neon project to another. This enables different usage scenarios, including:
Cross-region replication
: Replicating data from a Neon project in one region to a Neon project in another region to support regional failover scenarios.
Postgres version migration
: Moving data from one Postgres version to another; for example, from a Neon project that runs Postgres 16 to one that runs Postgres 17.
Region migration
: Moving data from one region to another; for example, from a Neon project in one region to a Neon project in a different region.
These are some common Neon-to-Neon replication scenarios. There may be others. You can follow the steps in this guide for any scenario that requires replicating data between different Neon projects.
Replicating between databases on the same Neon project branch
The procedure in this guide does not work for replicating between databases on the same Neon project branch
. That setup requires a slightly different publication and subscription configuration. For details, see
Replicating between databases on the same Neon project branch
.
Prerequisites
A Neon project with a database containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements to create a table with sample data:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
A destination Neon project.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
For information about creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Prepare your source Neon database
This section describes how to prepare your source Neon database (the publisher) for replicating data to your destination Neon database (the subscriber).
Enable logical replication in the source Neon project
In the Neon project containing your source database, enable logical replication. You only need to perform this step on the source Neon project.
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from
replica
to
logical
for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to
logical
, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section explains how to prepare your destination Neon Postgres database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data. For cross-region replication, be sure to create the destination Neon project in a different region than your source database.
Prepare your database schema
When configuring logical replication in Postgres, the tables in the source database you are replicating from must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. You can create the tables manually in your destination database or use utilities like
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
to dump the schema from your source database and load it to your destination database. See
Import a database schema
for instructions.
If you're using the sample
playing_with_neon
table, you can create the same table on the destination database with the following statement:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
Create a subscription
After creating a publication on the source database, you need to create a subscription on the destination database.
Use the
Neon SQL Editor
,
psql
, or another SQL client to connect to your destination database.
Create the subscription using the using a
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement.
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'postgresql://neondb_owner:<password>@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
subscription_name
: A name you chose for the subscription.
connection_string
: The connection string for the source Neon database where you defined the publication.
publication_name
: The name of the publication you created on the source Neon database.
Verify the subscription was created by running the following command:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
The subscription (
my_subscription
) should be listed, confirming that your subscription has been created successfully.
Test the replication
Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber database.
Run some data modifying queries on the source database (inserts, updates, or deletes). If you're using the
playing_with_neon
database, you can use this statement to insert some rows:
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
Perform a row count on the source and destination databases to make sure the result matches.
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
playing_with_neon;
count
-------
10
(
1
row
)
Alternatively, you can run the following query on the subscriber to make sure the
last_msg_receipt_time
is as expected. For example, if you just ran an insert option on the publisher, the
last_msg_receipt_time
should reflect the time of that operation.
SELECT
subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM
pg_catalog.pg_stat_subscription;
Switch over your application
After the replication operation is complete or in a failover situation, you can switch your application over to the destination database by swapping out your source database connection details for your destination database connection details.
You can find your Neon database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. See
Connect from any application

Replicate data from Postgres to Neon
Learn how to replicate data from a local Postgres instance or another Postgres provider to Neon
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from a local Postgres instance or another Postgres provider to Neon. If you're looking to replicate data from one Neon Postgres instance to another, see
Replicate data from one Neon project to another
.
Prerequisites
A local Postgres instance or Postgres instance hosted on another provider containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements to create a table with sample data:
CREATE

Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences.
Prepare your source Postgres database
This section describes how to prepare your source Postgres database (the publisher) for replicating data to your destination Neon database (the subscriber).
Enable logical replication in the source Neon project
On your source database, enable logical replication. The typical steps for a local Postgres instance are shown below. If you run Postgres on a provider, the steps may differ. Refer to your provider's documentation.
Enabling logical replication requires changing the Postgres
wal_level
configuration parameter from
replica
to
logical
.
Locate your
postgresql.conf
file. This is usually found in the PostgreSQL data directory. The data directory path can be identified by running the following query in your PostgreSQL database:
SHOW data_directory;
Open the
postgresql.conf
file in a text editor. Find the
wal_level
setting in the file. If it is not present, you can add it manually. Set
wal_level
to
logical
as shown below:
wal_level
=
logical
After saving the changes to
postgresql.conf
, you need to reload or restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect.
Confirm the change by running the following query in your PostgreSQL database:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Create a Postgres role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. The role must have the
REPLICATION
privilege. For example:
CREATE
ROLE
replication_user
WITH
REPLICATION
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'your_secure_password'
;
Grant schema access to your Postgres role
If your replication role does not own the schemas and tables you are replicating from, make sure to grant access. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
public
schema to Postgres role
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
public
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
public
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.

statement.
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'host=<host-address-or-ip> port=5432 dbname=postgres user=replication_user password=replication_user_password'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
subscription_name
: A name you chose for the subscription.
connection_string
: The connection string for the source Postgres database where you defined the publication.
publication_name
: The name of the publication you created on the source Postgres database.
Verify the subscription was created by running the following command:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
The subscription (
my_subscription
) should be listed, confirming that your subscription has been created successfully.
Test the replication
Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber database.
Run some data modifying queries on the source database (inserts, updates, or deletes). If you're using the
playing_with_neon
database, you can use this statement to insert some rows:

SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
playing_with_neon;
count
-------
30
(
1

SELECT
subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM
pg_catalog.pg_stat_subscription;

PrismaClient
()
.$extends
(
withPulse
({ apiKey
:
'<your Pulse API key>'
}));
note
For a real production use case, you should consider moving sensitive values like your API key into environment variables.
Create your first Pulse stream
The code below subscribes to a
User
model in your Prisma schema. You can use a similar approach to subscribe to any model that exists in your project.
import
{ PrismaClient }
from
'@prisma/client'
;
import
{ withPulse }
from
'@prisma/extension-pulse'
;
const
prisma
=
new
PrismaClient
()
.$extends
(
withPulse
({ apiKey
:
'<your Pulse API key>'
}));
async
function
main
() {
// Create a stream from the 'User' model
const
stream
=
await
prisma
.
user
.stream
({ name
:
'user-stream'
});
for
await
(
const
event
of
stream) {
console
.log
(
'Just received an event:'
,
event);
}
}
main
();
Trigger a database change
You can use Prisma Studio to easily make changes in your database, to trigger events. Open Prisma Studio by running:
npx prisma studio
After making a change in Studio, you should see messages appearing in your terminal like this:
Just
received
an
event:
{

Replicate data from Amazon RDS Postgres
Learn how to replicate data from Amazon RDS Postgres to Neon
New feature
If you are looking to migrate your database to Neon, you may want to try our new
Migration Assistant
, which can help. Read the
guide
to learn more.
Neon's logical replication feature allows you to replicate data from Amazon RDS PostgreSQL to Neon.
Prerequisites
A source database in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements to create a table with sample data:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
A destination Neon project. For information about creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences.
Prepare your source database
This section describes how to prepare your source Amazon RDS Postgres instance (the publisher) for replicating data to Neon.
Enable logical replication in the source Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instance
Enabling logical replication in Postgres requires changing the
wal_level
configuration parameter from
replica
to
logical
. Before you begin, you can check your current setting with the following command:
SHOW
wal_level
;
wal_level
-----------
replica
(
1
row
)
note
For information about connecting to RDS from
psql
, see
Connect to a PostgreSQL DB instance
.
If your current setting is
replica
, follow these steps to enable logical replication. If you are using the default parameter group, you will need to create a new parameter group to set the value. You can do so by selecting
Parameter groups
>
Create parameter group
from the sidebar and filling in the required fields.
To enable logical replication:
Navigate to the
Configuration
tab of your RDS instance.
Under the
Configuration
heading, click on the
DB instance parameter group
link.
Click
Edit
. In the
Filter parameters
search field, search for
rds.logical_replication
.
Set the value to
1
, and click
Save Changes
.
If you created a new parameter group, navigate back to your RDS instance page, click
Modify
, and scroll down to select your new parameter group. Click
Continue
, and select
Apply immediately
to make the change now, then click
Modify DB instance
.
Reboot your instance to apply the new setting. From the
Actions
menu for your database, select
Reboot
.
Make sure that the
wal_level
parameter is now set to
logical
:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
(
1
row
)
Allow connections from Neon
You need to allow inbound connections to your AWS RDS Postgres instance from Neon. You can do this by editing your instance's
CIDR/IP - Inbound
security group, which you can find a link to from your AWS RDS Postgres instance page.
Click on the security group name.
Click on the security group ID.
From the
Actions
menu, select
Edit inbound rules
.
Add rules that allow traffic from each of the IP addresses for your Neon project's region.
Neon uses 3 to 6 IP addresses per region for outbound communication, corresponding to each availability zone in the region. See
NAT Gateway IP addresses
for Neon's NAT gateway IP addresses.
When you're finished, click
Save rules
.
note
You can specify a rule for
0.0.0.0/0
to allow traffic from any IP address. However, this configuration is not considered secure.
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Prepare your destination database
This section describes how to prepare your source Neon Postgres database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data from your AWS RDS Postgres instance.
Prepare your database schema
When configuring logical replication in Postgres, the tables in the source database you are replicating from must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. You can create the tables manually in your destination database or use utilities like
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
to dump the schema from your source database and load it to your destination database. See
Import a database schema
for instructions.
If you're using the sample
playing_with_neon
table, you can create the same table on the destination database with the following statement:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
Create a subscription
After creating a publication on the source database, you need to create a subscription on your Neon destination database.
Use the
Neon SQL Editor
,
psql
, or another SQL client to connect to your destination database.
Create the subscription using the using a
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement.
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'postgresql://postgres:password@database-1.czmwaio8k05k.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com/postgres'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
subscription_name
: A name you chose for the subscription.
connection_string
: The connection string for the source AWS RDS Postgres database where you defined the publication.
publication_name
: The name of the publication you created on the source AWS RDS Postgres database.
Verify the subscription was created by running the following command:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
subid |     subname     | pid  | leader_pid | relid | received_lsn |      last_msg_send_time       |     last_msg_receipt_time     | latest_end_lsn |        latest_end_time
------+-----------------+------+------------+-------+--------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------------------

The subscription (
my_subscription
) should be listed, confirming that your subscription was created.
Test the replication
Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber database.
Run some data modifying queries on the source database (inserts, updates, or deletes). If you're using the
playing_with_neon
database, you can use this statement to insert some rows:
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
Perform a row count on the source and destination databases to make sure the result matches.
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
playing_with_neon;
count
-------
30
(
1
row
)
Alternatively, you can run the following query on the subscriber to make sure the
last_msg_receipt_time
is as expected. For example, if you just ran an insert option on the publisher, the
last_msg_receipt_time
should reflect the time of that operation.
SELECT
subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM
pg_catalog.pg_stat_subscription;
Switch over your application
After the replication operation is complete, you can switch your application over to the destination database by swapping out your AWS RDS source database connection details for your Neon destination database connection details.
You can find your Neon database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. See
Connect from any application
. See
Connect from any application

Replicate data from Supabase
Learn how to replicate data from Supabase to Neon
This guide describes how to replicate data from Supabase to Neon using native Postgres logical replication. The steps in this guide follow those described in
Replicate to another Postgres database using Logical Replication
, in the
Supabase documentation
.
Prerequisites
A Supabase project with a Postgres database containing the data you want to replicate. If you're just testing this out and need some data to play with, you can use the following statements in your Supabase SQL Editor to create a table with sample data:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
A Neon project with a Postgres database to receive the replicated data. For information about creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences.
Prepare your Supabase source database
This section describes how to prepare your source Supabase Postgres instance (the publisher) for replicating data to Neon.
Enable logical replication
Logical replication is enabled by default in Supabase. You can verify that
wal_level
is set to
logical
by running the following query in your Supabase SQL Editor or using
psql
connected to your Supabase database:
SHOW wal_level;
The output should be:
wal_level
-----------
logical
(1 row)
If
wal_level
is not
logical
, contact Supabase support to enable it.
Allow connections from Neon
You need to allow inbound connections to your Supabase Postgres database from the Neon NAT Gateway IP addresses. This allows Neon to connect to your Supabase database for logical replication. Follow these steps to configure network restrictions in Supabase:
Obtain Neon NAT Gateway IP Addresses
: See
NAT Gateway IP addresses
for the IP addresses for your Neon project's region. You will need to allow connections from these IP addresses in your Supabase project.
Configure Network Restrictions in Supabase
:
Go to your Supabase project dashboard.
Navigate to
Project Settings
>
Database
>
Network restrictions
.
Ensure you have
Owner
or
Admin
permissions for the Supabase project to configure network restrictions.
Add inbound rules to allow connections from the Neon NAT Gateway IP addresses you obtained in the previous step. Add each IP address individually.
Obtain a direct connection string
Logical replication requires a direct connection string, not a pooled connection string.
Enable IPv4 Add-on
: In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to
Project Settings
>
Add-ons
. Enable the
IPv4
add-on. This add-on is required to obtain a direct IPv4 connection string. Note that this add-on might incur extra costs.
Get the Direct Connection String
: After enabling the IPv4 add-on, copy the direct connection string from the
Connect
button in the Navigation bar of your Supabase dashboard. This connection string is required to create a subscription in Neon.
warning
Avoid using pooled connection strings (Transaction and session poolers) for logical replication. Use the direct connection string obtained after enabling the IPv4 add-on.
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated. You can run the following SQL statements in your Supabase SQL Editor or using
psql
to create a publication for the tables you want to replicate.
To create a publication for a specific table, use the
CREATE PUBLICATION
statement. For example, to create a publication for the
playing_with_neon
table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
playing_with_neon;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION my_publication
FOR
TABLE
users, departments;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your Neon Postgres database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data from your Supabase Postgres instance.
Prepare your database schema
When configuring logical replication in Postgres, the tables defined in your publication on the source database you are replicating from must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. You can create the tables manually in your destination database or use utilities like
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
to dump the schema from your source database and load it to your destination database. See
Import a database schema
for instructions.
If you're using the sample
playing_with_neon
table, you can create the same table on the destination database with the following statement in your Neon SQL Editor or using
psql
:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
playing_with_neon(id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
value
REAL
);
Create a subscription
After creating a publication on the source database, you need to create a subscription on your Neon destination database.
Use the
Neon SQL Editor
,
psql
, or another SQL client to connect to your Neon database.
Create the subscription using the
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement. Use the
direct connection string
you obtained from Supabase in the previous steps.
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription
CONNECTION
'postgresql://<supabase_connection_string>'
PUBLICATION my_publication;
Replace the following placeholders in the statement:
my_subscription
: A name you chose for the subscription.
postgresql://<supabase_connection_string>
: The
direct connection string
for your Supabase database, obtained with the IPv4 add-on enabled.
my_publication
: The name of the publication you created on the Supabase database.
Verify that the subscription was created in Neon by running the following query:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
subid   | subname         | worker_type | pid  | leader_pid | relid | received_lsn |     last_msg_send_time        |   last_msg_receipt_time      | latest_end_lsn |      latest_end_time

) should be listed, confirming that your subscription was created successfully.
note
Replication Slots Limits
: Supabase has limits on
max_replication_slots
and
max_wal_senders
which vary based on your Supabase instance size/plan. If you encounter issues, you might need to upgrade your Supabase instance to perform logical replication, especially for larger datasets or multiple replication slots. Check
Supabase documentation
for the limits on your instance size.
Test the replication
Testing your logical replication setup ensures that data is being replicated correctly from the publisher to the subscriber database.
Run some data modifying queries on the source database (inserts, updates, or deletes) in your Supabase SQL Editor or using
psql
. If you're using the
playing_with_neon
database, you can use this statement to insert 10 rows:
INSERT INTO
playing_with_neon(
name
,
value
)
SELECT
LEFT
(md5(i::
TEXT
),
10
), random()
FROM
generate_series
(
1
,
10
) s(i);
Perform a row count on both the Supabase source and Neon destination databases to make sure the result matches. In both databases, run:
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
playing_with_neon;
count
-------
20
(
1
row
)
The count should be the same in both databases, reflecting the newly inserted rows.
Alternatively, you can run the following query on the subscriber (Neon) to make sure the
last_msg_receipt_time
is updated and as expected.
SELECT
subname, received_lsn, latest_end_lsn, last_msg_receipt_time
FROM
pg_catalog.pg_stat_subscription;
Switch over your application
After the replication operation is complete and you have verified that data is being replicated correctly, you can switch your application over to the Neon database.
Stop writes to your Supabase database.
Wait for any final transactions to be replicated to Neon. Monitor
pg_stat_subscription
in Neon until
received_lsn
and
latest_end_lsn
are close or equal, indicating minimal replication lag.
Update your application's connection string to point to your Neon database.
You can find your Neon database connection details by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For details, see
Connect from any application

)
Next, create a repository interface to interact with the database:
// src/main/kotlin/com/example/repository/BookRepository.kt
package
com.example.repository
import
com.example.entity.Book
import
io.micronaut.data.jdbc.annotation.JdbcRepository

Multitenancy with Neon
How to configure Neon for multitenancy - plus a few design tips
With its serverless and API-first nature, Neon is an excellent choice for building database-per-user applications (or apps where each user/customer has their own Postgres database). Neon is particularly well-suited for architectures that prioritize maximum database isolation, achieving the equivalent of instance-level isolation.
This guide will help you get started with implementing this architecture.
Multitenant architectures in Postgres
In a multitenant architecture, a single system supports multiple users (tenants), each with access to manage their own data. In a database like Postgres, this setup requires careful structuring to keep each tenant's data private, secure, and isolated—all while remaining efficient to manage and scale.
Following these principles, there are three primary routes you could follow to implement multitenant architectures in Postgres:
Creating one separate database per user (the focus of this guide);
Creating one schema-per-user, within the same database;
And keeping your tenants separate within a shared schema.
To better situate our use case, let's briefly outline the differences between these architectures:
Database-per-user
In a database-per-user design, each user's data is fully isolated in its own database, eliminating any risk of data overlap. This setup is straightforward to design and highly secure. However, implementing this in managed Postgres databases has traditionally been challenging. For users of AWS RDS, Amazon Aurora, or similar services, two primary options have existed for achieving a database-per-user design:
Using one large instance to host multiple user databases.
This option can be tempting due to the reduced number of instances to manage and (probably) lower infrastructure costs. But the trade-off is a higher demand for DBA expertise—this is a design that requires careful planning, especially at scale. Hosting all users on shared resources can impact performance, particularly if users have varying workload patterns, and if the instance fails, all customers are affected. Migrations and upgrades also become complex.
Handling multiple instances, each hosting a single production database.
In this scenario, each instance scales independently, preventing resource competition between users and minimizing the risk of widespread failures. This is a much simpler design from the perspective of the database layer, but managing hundreds of instances in AWS can get very costly and complex. As the number of instances grows into the thousands, management becomes nearly impossible.
As we'll see later throughout this guide, Neon offers a third alternative by providing a logical equivalent to the instance-per-customer model with near-infinite scalability, without the heavy DevOps overhead. This solution involves creating one Neon project per customer.
Schema-per-user
But before focusing on database-per-user, let's briefly cover another multitenancy approach in Postgres: the schema-per-user model. Instead of isolating data by database, this design places all users in a single database, with a unique schema for each.
In Neon, we generally don't recommend this approach for SaaS applications, unless this is a design you're already experienced with. This approach doesn't reduce operational complexity or costs if compared to the many-databases approach, but it does introduce additional risks; it also limits the potential of Neon features like instant Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR), which in a project-per-customer model allows you to restore customer databases independently without impacting the entire fleet's operations. More about this later.
Shared schema
Lastly, Postgres's robustness actually makes it possible to ensure tenant isolation within a shared schema. In this model, all users' data resides within the same tables, with isolation enforced through foreign keys and row-level security.
While this is a common choice—and can be a good starting point if you're just beginning to build your app—we still recommend the project-per-user route if possible. Over time, as your app scales, meeting requirements within a shared schema setup becomes increasingly challenging. Enforcing compliance and managing access restrictions at the schema level grows more complex as you add more users.
You'll also need to manage very large Postgres tables, as all customer data is stored in the same tables. As these tables grow, additional Postgres fine-tuning will be required to maintain performance.
Setting up Neon for Database-per-user
Now that we've reviewed your options, let's focus on the design choice we recommend for multitenancy in Neon: creating isolated databases for each user, with each database hosted on its own project.
Database-per-user = Project-per-user
We recommend setting up one project per user, rather than, for example, using a branch per customer. A Neon
project
serves as the logical equivalent of an "instance" but without the management overhead. Here's why we suggest this design:
Straightforward scalability
Instead of learning how to handle large Postgres databases, this model allows you to simply create a new project when a user joins—something that can be handled automatically via the Neon API. This approach is very cost-effective, as we'll see below. Databases remain small, keeping management at the database level simple.
Better performance with lower costs
This design is also highly efficient in terms of compute usage. Each project has its own dedicated compute, which scales up and down independently per customer; a spike in usage for one tenant doesn't affect others, and inactive projects remain practically free.
Complete data isolation
By creating a dedicated project for each customer, their data remains completely separate from others, ensuring the highest level of security and privacy.
Easier regional compliance
Each Neon project can be deployed in a specific region, making it easy to host customer data closer to their location.
Per-customer PITR
Setting up a project per customer allows you to run
PITR on individual customers
instantly, without risking disruption to your entire fleet.
Managing many projects
As you scale, following a project-per-user design means eventually managing thousands of Neon projects. This might sound overwhelming, but it's much simpler in practice than it seems—some Neon users
manage hundreds of thousands of projects
with just one engineer. Here's why that's possible:
You can manage everything with the Neon API
The API allows you to automate every step of project management, including setting resource limits per customer and configuring resources.
No infrastructure provisioning
New Neon projects are ready in milliseconds. You can set things up to create new projects instantly when new customers join, without the need to manually pre-provision instances.
You only pay for active projects
Empty projects are virtually free thanks to Neon's
scale-to-zero
feature. If, on a given day, you have a few hundred projects that were only active for a few minutes, that's fine—your bill won't suffer.
Subscription plans
To support this usage pattern, our pricing plans include a generous number of projects within the monthly subscription fee, allowing you to scale without a big budget:
The Launch plan includes 100 projects for $19/month.
The Scale plan includes 1,000 projects for $69/month.
The Business plan includes 5,000 projects for $700/month.
Dev/test environments
In Neon,
database branching
is a powerful feature that enables you to create fast, isolated copies of your data for development and testing. You can use child branches as ephemeral environments that mirror your main testing database but operate independently, without adding to storage costs. This feature is a game-changer for dev/test workflows, as it reduces the complexity of managing multiple test databases while lowering non-prod costs significantly.
To handle
dev/test
in a project-per-user design, consider creating a dedicated Neon project as your non-prod environment. This Neon project can serve as a substitute for the numerous non-prod instances you might maintain in RDS/Aurora.
The methodology:
Within the non-prod project, load your testing data into the production branch.
This production branch will serve as the primary source for all dev/test environments.
Create ephemeral environments via child branches.
For each ephemeral environment, create a child branch from the production branch. These branches are fully isolated in terms of resources and come with an up-to-date copy of your testing dataset.
Automate the process.
Use CI/CD and automations to streamline your workflow. You can reset child branches with one click to keep them in sync with the production branch as needed, maintaining data consistency across your dev/test environments.
Designing a Control Plane
Once you have everything set up, as your number of projects grows, you might want to create a control plane to stay on top of everything in a centralized manner.
The catalog database
The catalog database is a centralized repository that tracks and manages all Neon projects and databases. It holds records for every Neon project your system creates. You can also use it to keep track of tenant-specific configurations, such as database names, regions, schema versions, and so on.
You can set up your catalog database as a separate Neon project. When it's time to design its schema, consider these tips:
Use foreign keys to link tables like
project
and
payment
to
customer
.
Choose data types carefully:
citext
for case-insensitive text,
uuid
for unique identifiers to obscure sequence data, and
timestamptz
for tracking real-world time.
Track key operational data, like
schema_version
, in the
project
table.
Index wisely! While the catalog will likely remain smaller than user databases, it will grow—especially with recurring events like payments—so indexing is crucial for control plane performance at scale.
Start with essential data fields and plan for future extensions as needs evolve.
Standard Neon metadata (e.g., compute size, branch info) is accessible via the console. Avoid duplicating it in the catalog database unless separate access adds significant complexity.
Automations
To effectively scale a multitenant architecture, leveraging automation tools is essential. The Neon API will allow you to automate various tasks, such as creating and managing projects, setting usage limits, and configuring resources. Beyond the API, Neon offers several integrations to streamline your workflows:
GitHub Actions
Neon's
GitHub integration
allows you to automate database branching workflows directly from your repositories. By connecting a Neon project to a GitHub repository, you can set up actions that create or delete database branches in response to pull request events, facilitating isolated testing environments for each feature or bug fix.
Vercel Integration
You can
connect your Vercel projects to Neon
, creating database branches for each preview deployment.
CI/CD pipelines
By combining Neon branching into your CI/CD, you can simplify your dev/test workflows by creating and deleting ephemeral environments automatically as child branches.
Automated backups to your own S3
If you must keep your own data copy, you can
schedule regular backups
using tools like
pg_dump
in conjunction with GitHub Actions.
The Application Layer
Although the application layer isn't our main focus, a common question developers ask us when approaching a multitenant architecture is:
Do I deploy one application environment per database, or connect all databases to a single application environment?
Both approaches are viable, each with its own pros and cons.
Shared application environments
Pros of shared environments
Managing a single application instance minimizes operational complexity.
Updates and new features are easy to implement since changes apply universally.
Operating one environment reduces infrastructure and maintenance costs.
Cons of shared environments
A single application environment makes it difficult to offer tailored experiences for individual customers.
Compliance becomes challenging when users' databases span multiple regions.
Updates apply to all users simultaneously, which can be problematic for those needing specific software versions.
A single environment heightens the risk of data breaches, as vulnerabilities can impact all users.
Advice
Implement robust authorization
Ensure secure access as all users share the same application environment.
Define user authentication and data routing
Users provide their organization details during login.
Users access the application via an organization-specific subdomain.
The system identifies the user's organization based on their credentials.
Monitor usage and performance
Regularly track application usage to prevent performance bottlenecks.
Plan maintenance windows carefully
Minimize disruptions for all users by scheduling maintenance during low-usage periods.
Isolated application environments
In this architecture, each customer has instead a dedicated application environment alongside their own database. Similar to the shared environment option, this design has pros and cons:
Pros of isolated environments
Since each customer can now have a unique application environment, it's easier to implement personalized features and configurations, to keep separate versions for particular customers, and so on.
Compliance is also simpler if you're handling multiple regions. Deploying the application in multiple regions can also help with latency.
This design also opens the door for customers to control their own upgrade schedules, e.g., via defining their own maintenance windows.
Cons of isolated environments
This design has an obvious tradeoff: it comes with higher complexity of deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.
You'll need to think about how to route optimal resource utilization across multiple environments, and how to keep observability on-point to diagnose issues.
Operating separate environments for each customer might also lead to higher costs.
Advice
If you decide to implement isolated environments, here's some advice to consider:
Design your architecture to accommodate growth, even if your setup is small today.
Similarly as you're doing with Neon projects, take advantage of automation tools to streamline the creation and management of your application environments.
Set up proper monitoring to track key metrics across all environments.
Migrating Schemas
In a database-per-user design, it is common to have the same schema for all users/databases. Any changes to the user schema will most likely be rolled out to all individual databases simultaneously. In this section, we teach you how to use DrizzleORM, GitHub Actions, the Neon API, and a couple of custom template scripts to manage many databases using the same database schema.
Example app
To walk you through it, we've created example code
in this repository
. The example includes 4 Neon databases, all using Postgres 16 and all deployed to AWS us-east-1.
The schema consists of three tables,
users
,
projects
and
tasks
. You can see the schema here:
schema.ts
, and for good measure, here's the raw SQL equivalent:
schema.sql
. This default schema is referenced by each of the
drizzle.config.ts
files that have been created for each customer.
Workflow using Drizzle ORM and GitHub Actions
Creating Neon projects via a CLI script
Our example creates new Neon projects via the command line, using the following script:
// src/scripts/create.js
import
{ Command }
from
'commander'
;
import
{ createApiClient }
from
'@neondatabase/api-client'
;
import
'dotenv/config'
;
const
program
=
new
Command
();
const
neonApi
=
createApiClient
({
apiKey
:
process
.
env
.
NEON_API_KEY
,
});
program
.option
(
'-n, --name <name>'
,
'Name of the company'
)
.parse
(
process
.argv);
const
options
=
program
.opts
();
if
(
options
.name) {
console
.log
(
`Company Name:
${
options
.name
}
`
);
(
async
()
=>
{
try
{
const
response
=
await
neonApi
.createProject
({
project
:
{
name
:
options
.name
,
pg_version
:
16
,
region_id
:
'aws-us-east-1'
,
}
,
});
const
{
data
}
=
response;
console
.log
(data);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Error creating project:'
,
error);
}
})();
}
else
{
console
.log
(
'No company name provided'
);
}
This script utilizes the
commander
library to create a simple command-line interface (CLI) and the Neon API's
createProject
method to set up a new project. Ensure that your Neon API key is stored in an environment variable named
NEON_API_KEY
.
To execute the script and create a new Neon project named "ACME Corp" with PostgreSQL version 16 in the aws-us-east-1 region, run:
npm
run
create
--
--name=
"ACME Corp"
In this example, the same approach was used to create the following projects:
ACME Corp
Payroll Inc
Finance Co
Talent Biz
To interact with the Neon API, you'll need to generate an API key. For more information, refer to the Neon documentation on
creating an API key

This script automates the setup process for managing multiple Neon databases. It:
Retrieves all Neon projects using the Neon API.
For each project, it generates a Drizzle configuration file with the appropriate connection string.
Creates a GitHub workflow file for each project to handle schema migrations.

--config=./configs/acme-corp.config.ts
Or, if you've set up the GitHub workflows as described, migrations will automatically run whenever you push changes to the
src/db/schema.ts
file on the main branch.
S3 Backups
In addition to managing schemas, you might want to set up regular backups of your databases. This section explains how to configure AWS IAM roles and policies for GitHub Actions to securely access S3 for backing up your Neon databases.
AWS IAM configuration
First, GitHub must be added as an identity provider to allow the Action to use your AWS credentials. To create a new Identity Provider, navigate to IAM > Access Management > Identity Providers, and click Add provider.
On the next screen select OpenID Connect and add the following to the Provider URL and Audience fields.
Provider URL:
https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
Now, you must create a role, which is an identity that you can assume to obtain temporary security credentials for specific tasks or actions within AWS. Navigate to
IAM > Access Management > Roles
, and click
Create role
.
On the next screen you can create a Trusted Identity for the Role. Select
Trusted Identity
. On the next screen, select
Web Identity
, then select
token.actions.githubusercontent.com
from the
Identity Provider
dropdown menu.
Once you select the Identity Provider, you'll be shown a number of fields to fill out. Select
sts.amazonaws.com
from the
Audience
dropdown menu, then fill out the GitHub repository details as per your requirements. When you're ready, click
Next
. For reference, the options shown in the image below are for this repository.
You can skip selecting anything from the Add Permissions screen and click
Next
to continue.
On this screen give the
Role
a name and description. You'll use the Role name in the code for the GitHub Action. When you're ready click
Create role
.
Now you need to create a policy for the role. Navigate to
IAM > Access Management > Policies
, and click
Create policy
.
On the next screen, select the
JSON
tab and paste the following policy. This policy allows the role to list, get, put, and delete objects in the specified S3 bucket. Replace
your-bucket-name
with the name of your S3 bucket.
{
"Version"
:
"2012-10-17"
,
"Statement"
:
[
{
"Effect"
:
"Allow"
,
"Action"
:
[
"s3:ListBucket"
]
,
"Resource"
:
[
"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name"
]
}
,
{
"Effect"
:
"Allow"
,
"Action"
:
[
"s3:PutObject"
,
"s3:GetObject"
,
"s3:DeleteObject"
]
,
"Resource"
:
[
"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
]
}
]
}
Click
Next
and give the policy a name and description. When you're ready, click
Create policy
.
Now you need to attach the policy to the role. Navigate to
IAM > Access Management > Roles
, and click on the role you created earlier. Click
Add permissions
, then
Attach policies
. Search for the policy you just created, select it, and click
Add permissions
.
GitHub secrets
You'll need to add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
: Your AWS account ID
IAM_ROLE
: In my case this would be, neon-multiple-db-s3-backups-github-action
Scheduled pg_dump/restore GitHub Action
Before diving into the code, here's a look at this example in the Neon console dashboard. There are three databases set up for three fictional customers, all running Postgres 16 and all are deployed to us-east-1. We will be backing up each database into its own folder within an S3 bucket, with different schedules and retention periods. All the code in this example lives
in this repository
.
Using the same naming conventions, there are three new files in the ``.github/workflows` folder in the repository:
paycorp-payments-prod.yml
acme-analytics-prod.yml
paycorp-payments-prod.yml
All the Actions are technically the same, (besides the name of the file), but there are several areas where they differ.
These are:
The workflow name
The
DATABASE_URL
The
RETENTION
period
For example, in the first
.yml
file, the workflow name is
acme-analytics-prod
, the
DATABASE_URL
points to
secrets.ACME_ANALYTICS_PROD
, and the
RETENTION
period is 7 days.
Here's the full Action, and below the code snippet, we'll explain how it all works.

: This is the name of the S3 bucket where all backups are being stored.
AWS_REGION
: This is the region where the S3 bucket is deployed.
PG_VERSION
: This is the version of Postgres to install.
GitHub Secrets
As we mentioned above, several of the above environment variables are defined using secrets. These variables can be added to
Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
.
Here's a screenshot of the GitHub repository secrets including the connection string for the fictional ACME Analytics Prod database.
Action steps
This step installs Postgres into the GitHub Action's virtual environment. The version to install is defined by the
PG_VERSION
environment variable.
Install Postgres
-
name
:
Install PostgreSQL
run
:
|
sudo apt install -y postgresql-common
yes '' | sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
sudo apt install -y postgresql-${{ env.PG_VERSION }}
Configure AWS credentials
This step configures AWS credentials within the GitHub Action virtual environment, allowing the workflow to interact with AWS services securely.
-
name
:
Configure AWS credentials
uses
:
aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
with
:
role-to-assume
:
arn:aws:iam::${{ env.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}:role/${{ env.IAM_ROLE }}
aws-region
:
${{ env.AWS_REGION }}
Set file, folder and path variables
In this step I've created three variables that are all output to
GITHUB_ENV
. This allows me to access the values from other steps in the Action.
-
name
:
Set file, folder and path variables
run
:
|
GZIP_NAME="$(date +'%B-%d-%Y@%H:%M:%S').gz"
FOLDER_NAME="${{ github.workflow }}"
UPLOAD_PATH="s3://${{ env.S3_BUCKET_NAME }}/${FOLDER_NAME}/${GZIP_NAME}"
echo "GZIP_NAME=${GZIP_NAME}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
echo "FOLDER_NAME=${FOLDER_NAME}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
echo "UPLOAD_PATH=${UPLOAD_PATH}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
The three variables are as follows:
GZIP_NAME
: The name of the
.gz
file derived from the date which would produce a file name similar to,
October-21-2024@07:53:02.gz
FOLDER_NAME
: The folder where the
.gz
files are to be uploaded
UPLOAD_PATH
: This is the full path that includes the S3 bucket name, folder name and
.gz
file
Create folder if it doesn't exist
This step creates a new folder (if one doesn't already exist) inside the S3 bucket using the
FOLDER_NAME
as defined in the previous step.
Final remarks
You can create as many of these Actions as you need. Just be careful to double check the
DATABASE_URL
to avoid backing up a database to the wrong folder.
important
GitHub Actions will timeout after ~6 hours. The size of your database and how you've configured it will determine how long the
pg_dump
step takes. If you do experience timeout issues, you can self host
GitHub Action runners

The Neon GitHub integration
Connect Neon Postgres to a GitHub repository and build GitHub Actions workflows
The Neon GitHub integration connects your Neon project to a GitHub repository, streamlining database development within your overall application development workflow. For instance, you can configure GitHub Actions to create a database branch for each pull request and automatically apply schema changes to that database branch. To help you get started, we provide a
sample GitHub Actions workflow
.
How it works
The integration installs the GitHub App, letting you select which repositories you want to make accessible to Neon. When you connect a Neon project to a GitHub repository, the integration sets a Neon API key secret and Neon project ID variable in your repository, which are used by your GitHub Actions workflow to interact with your Neon project.
note
The
sample GitHub Actions workflow
we provide is intended as a basic template you can expand on or customize to build your own workflows.
This guide walks you through the following steps:
Installing the GitHub App
Connecting a Neon project to a GitHub repository
Adding the sample GitHub Actions workflow to your repository
Prerequisites
You have a Neon account and project. If not, see
Sign up for a Neon account
.
You have a GitHub account with an application repository that you want to connect to your Neon project.
Install the GitHub App and connect your Neon project
To get started:
In the Neon Console, navigate to the
Integrations
page in your Neon project.
Locate the
GitHub
card and click
Add
.
On the
GitHub
drawer, click
Install GitHub App
.
If you have more than one GitHub account, select the account where you want to install the GitHub app.
Select whether to install and authorize the GitHub app for
All repositories
in your GitHub account or
Only select repositories
.
Selecting
All repositories
authorizes the app on all repositories in your GitHub account, meaning that you can to connect your Neon project to any of them.
Selecting
Only select repositories
authorizes the app on one or more repositories, meaning that you can only connect your Neon project to the selected repositories (you can authorize additional repositories later if you need to).
If you authorized the app on
All repositories
or multiple repositories, select a GitHub repository to connect to the current Neon project, and click
Connect
. If you authorized the GitHub app on a single GitHub repository, you have already completed this step.
You are directed to the
Actions
tab on the final page of the setup, where a sample GitHub Actions workflow is provided. You can copy this workflow to your GitHub repository to establish a basic database branching process. For instructions, see
Add the GitHub Actions workflow to your repository
.
Add the GitHub Actions workflow to your repository
The sample GitHub Actions workflow includes:
A
Create branch action
that creates a new Neon branch in your Neon project when you open or reopen a pull request in the connected GitHub repository.
Code that you can uncomment to add a database migration command to your workflow.
Code that you can uncomment to add a
Schema diff action
that diffs database schemas and posts the diff as a comment in your pull request.
A
Delete branch action
that deletes the Neon branch from your Neon project when you close the pull request.

# on it, or send the connection details to a hosting platform environment.
# The branch DATABASE_URL is available to you via:
# "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}".
# It's important you don't log the DATABASE_URL as output as it contains a username and

# You can also add a Schema Diff action to compare the database schema on the new
# branch with the base branch. This action automatically writes the schema differences
# as a comment on your GitHub pull request, making it easy to review changes.
# Following the step above, which runs database migrations, you may want to check
# for schema changes in your database. We recommend using the following action to
# post a comment to your pull request with the schema diff. For this action to work,
# you also need to give permissions to the workflow job to be able to post comments
# and read your repository contents. Add the following permissions to the workflow job:
#
# permissions:
#   contents: read
#   pull-requests: write

.github/workflows
directory already exists, add the file.
If your repository doesn't have a
.github/workflows
directory, add the file
.github/workflows/neon-workflow.yml
. This creates the
.github
and
workflows
directories and the
neon-workflow.yml
file.
If you need more help with this step, see
Creating your first workflow
, in the
GitHub documentation
.
note
For GitHub to discover GitHub Actions workflows, you must save the workflow files in a directory called
.github/workflows
in your repository. You can name the workflow file whatever you like, but you must use
.yml
or
.yaml
as the file name extension.
Copy the workflow code into your
neon-workflow.yml
file.
Commit your changes.
Using the GitHub Actions workflow
To use the sample workflow, create a pull request in your GitHub application repository. This will trigger the
Create Neon Branch
action. You can verify that a branch was created on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console. You should see a new branch with a
preview/pr-
name prefix.
Closing the pull request removes the Neon branch from the Neon project, which you can also verify on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console.
To view workflow results in GitHub, follow the instructions in
Viewing your workflow results
, in the
GitHub documentation
.
Building your own GitHub Actions workflow
The sample workflow provided by the GitHub integration serves as a template, which you can expand on or customize. The workflow uses Neon's create branch, delete branch, and schema diff GitHub Actions, which you can find here:
Create a Neon Branch
Delete a Neon Branch
Schema Diff
Neon also offers a
Reset a Neon Branch
action that allows you to reset a database branch to match the current state of its parent branch. This action is useful in a feature-development workflow, where you may need to reset a development branch to the current state of your production branch before beginning work on a new feature.
To incorporate the reset action into your workflow, you can use code like this, tailored to your specific requirements:
reset_neon_branch
:
name
:
Reset Neon Branch
needs
:

if
:

If you've installed the GitHub app previously, it's available to use with any project in your Neon account.
To connect another Neon project to a GitHub repository:
In the Neon Console, navigate to the
Integrations
page in your Neon project.
Locate the
GitHub
integration and click
Add
.
Select a GitHub repository to connect to your Neon project, and click
Connect
.
note
Connecting to the same GitHub repository from different Neon projects is not supported.
Secret and variable set by the GitHub integration
When connecting a Neon project to a GitHub repository, the GitHub integration performs the following actions:
Generates a Neon API key for your Neon account
Creates a
NEON_API_KEY
secret in your GitHub repository
Adds a
NEON_PROJECT_ID
variable to your GitHub repository
The
NEON_API_KEY
allows you to run any
Neon API
method or
Neon CLI
command, which means you can develop actions and workflows that create, update, and delete various objects in Neon such as projects, branches, databases, roles, and computes.
The
NEON_PROJECT_ID
variable defines the Neon project that is connected to the repository. Operations run on Neon via the Neon API or CLI typically require specifying the Neon project ID, as a Neon account may have more than one Neon project.
The sample GitHub Actions workflow provided by the Neon GitHub integration depends on these variables and secrets to perform actions in Neon.
note
The variables and secrets are removed if you disconnect a Neon project from the associated GitHub repository. The items are removed for all Neon projects and associated repositories if you remove the Neon GitHub integration from your Neon account. See
Remove the GitHub integration

Neon Private Networking
Learn how to connect to your Neon database via AWS PrivateLink
Private Networking availability
Private Networking is available on Neon's
Business
and
Enterprise
plans. If you're on a different plan, you can request a trial from the
Network Security
page in your project's settings.
The
Neon Private Networking
feature enables secure connections to your Neon databases via
AWS PrivateLink
, bypassing the open internet for enhanced security.
Overview
In a standard setup, the client application connects to a Neon database over the open internet via the Neon proxy.
With
Neon Private Networking
, you can connect to your database via AWS PrivateLink instead of the open internet. In this setup, the client application connects through an
AWS endpoint service
(provided by Neon) to a Neon proxy instance that is not accessible from the public internet. This endpoint service is available only within the same AWS region as your client application. With
Neon Private Networking
, all traffic between the client application and the Neon database stays within AWS's private network, rather than crossing the public internet.
Prerequisites
You must be a Neon
Business
and
Enterprise
account user, and your user account must be
Neon organization
Admin account. You'll encounter an access error if you attempt the setup from a personal Neon account or on a Neon plan that does not offer Private Networking.
Ensure that your client application is deployed on AWS in the same region as the Neon database you plan to connect to.
The Private Networking feature is available in all
Neon-supported AWS regions
. Both your private access client application and Neon database must be in one of these regions.
The Neon Private Networking feature currently supports
IPv4
addresses.
IPv6
is not supported at this time.
Install the Neon CLI. You will use it to add your VPC endpoint ID to your Neon organization. For installation instructions, see
Neon CLI — Install and connect
.
Configuration steps
To configure Neon Private Networking, perform the following steps:
Create an AWS VPC endpoint
important
Do not enable
private DNS names
for the VPC endpoint until
Step 3
. You must add the VPC endpoint to your Neon organization first, as described in
Step 2
.
Go to the AWS
VPC > Endpoints
dashboard and select
Create endpoint
. Make sure you create the endpoint in the same VPC as your client application.
Optionally, enter a
Name tag
for the endpoint (e.g.,
My Neon Private Networking
).
For
Type
, select the
Endpoint services that use NLBs and GWLBs
category.
Under
Service settings
, specify the
Service name
. It must be one of the following service names, depending on your region:
us-east-1
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0de57c578b0e614a9
us-east-2
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-2.vpce-svc-010736480bcef5824
eu-central-1
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.eu-central-1.vpce-svc-05554c35009a5eccb
aws-eu-west-2
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.eu-west-2.vpce-svc-0c6fedbe99fced2cd
us-west-2
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.us-west-2.vpce-svc-060e0d5f582365b8e
ap-southeast-1
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.ap-southeast-1.vpce-svc-07c68d307f9f05687
ap-southeast-2
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.ap-southeast-2.vpce-svc-031161490f5647f32
aws-sa-east-1
:
com.amazonaws.vpce.sa-east-1.vpce-svc-061204a851dbd1a47
Click
Verify service
. If successful, you should see a
Service name verified
message.
If not successful, ensure that your service name matches the region where you're creating the VPC endpoint.
Select the VPC where your application is deployed.
Add the availability zones and associated subnets you want to support.
Click
Create endpoint
to complete the setup of the endpoint service.
Note your
VPC Endpoint ID
. You will need it in the next step.
Add your VPC Endpoint ID to your Neon organization
Assign your
VPC Endpoint ID
to your Neon organization. You can do this using the Neon CLI or API.
note
Please note that you must assign the
VPC Endpoint ID
, not the VPC ID.
CLI
API
In the following example, the VCP endpoint ID is assigned to a Neon organization in the specified AWS region using the
neon vpc endpoint
command.
neon
vpc
endpoint
assign
vpce-1234567890abcdef0
--org-id
org-bold-bonus-12345678
--region-id
aws-us-east-2
You can find your Neon organization ID in your Neon organization settings, or you can run this Neon CLI command:
neon orgs list
Optionally, you can limit access to a Neon project by allowing connections only from a specific VPC endpoint. For instructions, see
Assigning a VPC endpoint restrictions
.
Enable Private DNS
After adding your VPC endpoint ID to your Neon organization, enable private DNS lookup for the VPC endpoint in AWS.
In AWS, select the VPC endpoint you created.
Choose
Modify private DNS name
.
Select
Enable for this endpoint
.
Save your changes.
Check your database connection string
Your Neon database connection string does not change when using Private Networking.
To verify that your connection is working correctly, you can perform a DNS lookup on your Neon endpoint hostname from within your AWS VPC. It should resolve to the private IP address of the VPC endpoint.
For example, if your Neon database connection string is:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
You can run the following command from an EC2 instance inside your AWS VPC:
nslookup
ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
Restrict public internet access
At this point, it's still possible to connect to a database in your Neon project over the public internet using a database connection string.
You can restrict public internet access to your Neon project via the Neon CLI or API.
CLI
API
To block access via the Neon CLI, use the
neon projects update
command with the
--block-public-connections
option.
neon
projects
update
orange-credit-12345678
--block-public-connections
true
In the example above,
orange-credit-12345678
is the Neon project ID. You can find
your
Neon project ID under your project's settings in the Neon Console, or by running this Neon CLI command:
neon projects list
Assigning a VPC endpoint restriction
You can limit access to a Neon project by allowing connections only from specified VPC endpoints. Use the Neon CLI or API to set a restriction.
CLI
API
You can specify a CLI command similar to the following to restrict project access:
neon
vpc
project
restrict
vpce-1234567890abcdef0
--project-id
orange-credit-12345678
You will need to provide the VPC endpoint ID and your Neon project ID. You can find your Neon project ID under your project's settings in the Neon Console, or by running this Neon CLI command:
neon projects list
After adding a restriction, you can check the status of the VPC endpoint to view the restricted project using the
vpc endpoint status command
. You will need to provide your VPC endpoint ID, region ID, and Neon organization ID.
neonctl
vpc

Managing Private Networking using the Neon CLI
You can use the Neon CLI
vpc
command to manage Private Networking configurations in Neon.
The
vpc
command includes
endpoint
and
project
subcommands for managing VPC endpoints and project-level VPC endpoint restrictions:
vpc endpoint
– List, assign, remove, and retrieve the status of VPC endpoints for a Neon organization.
vpc project
– List, configure, or remove VPC endpoint restrictions for specific Neon projects.
For more details and examples, see
Neon CLI commands — vpc
.
Managing Private Networking using the Neon API
The Neon API provides endpoints for managing VPC endpoints and project-level VPC endpoint restrictions:
APIs for managing VPC endpoints
List VPC endpoints
Assign or update a VPC endpoint
Retrieve VPC endpoint configuration details
Delete a VPC endpoint
APIs for managing VPC endpoint restrictions
Get VPC endpoint restrictions
Assign or update a VPC endpoint restriction
Delete a VPC endpoint restriction
Private Networking limits
The Private Networking feature supports a maximum of
10 private networking configurations per AWS region
. Supported AWS regions are listed
above
.
Limitations
If you remove a VPC endpoint from a Neon organization, that VPC endpoint cannot be added back to the same Neon organization. Attempting to do so will result in an error. In this case, you must set up a new VPC endpoint.

Neon RLS Tutorial
Postgres Row-Level Security tutorial
Simplify RLS with Drizzle
Neon RLS
integrates with third-party
JWT-based authentication providers
like Auth0 and Clerk, bringing authorization closer to your data by leveraging
Row-Level Security (RLS)
at the database level.
Authentication and authorization
When implementing user authentication in your application, third-party authentication providers like
Clerk
,
Auth0
, and others simplify the process of managing user identities, passwords, and security tokens. Once a user's identity is confirmed, the next step is
authorization
— controlling who can do what in your app based on their user type or role — for example, admins versus regular users. With Neon RLS, you can manage authorization directly within Postgres, either alongside or as a complete replacement for security at other layers.
How Neon RLS works
Most authentication providers issue
JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
on user authentication to convey user identity and claims. The JWT is a secure way of proving that logged-in users are who they say they are — and passing that proof on to other entities.
With
Neon RLS
, the JWT is passed on to Neon, where you can make use of the validated user identity directly in Postgres. To integrate with an authentication provider, you will add your provider's JWT discovery URL to your Neon project. This lets Neon retrieve the necessary keys to validate the JWTs.
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL
,
{ authToken
:
myAuthProvider
.getJWT
() });
await
sql
(
`select * from todos`
);
Behind the scenes, the
Neon Proxy
performs the validation, while Neon's open source
pg_session_jwt
extension makes the extracted
user_id
available to Postgres. You can then use
Row-Level Security (RLS)
policies in Postgres to enforce access control at the row level, ensuring that users can only access or modify data according to the defined rules. Since these rules are implemented directly in the database, they can offer a secure fallback — or even a primary authorization solution — in case security in other layers of your application fail. See
when to rely on RLS
for more information.
Database roles
Neon RLS works with two database roles, identified by connection string prefixes:
Authenticated role
(
authenticated@
): For users who are logged in. Requires a valid JWT token from your authentication provider.
Anonymous role
(
anonymous@
): Currently requires authentication similar to the authenticated role. This implementation is under review and may change in the future to better support unauthenticated access.
note
For now, if you need to implement public access in your application, we recommend creating a separate database role with a password. This provides a simpler alternative to using the anonymous role while we work on improving anonymous access support.
Using Neon RLS with custom JWTs
If you don't want to use a third-party authentication provider, you can build your application to generate and sign its own JWTs. Here's a sample application that demonstrates this approach:
See demo
Before and after Neon RLS
Let's take a
before/after
look at moving authorization from the application level to the database to demonstrate how Neon RLS offers a different approach to securing your application.
Before Neon RLS (application-level checks):
In a traditional setup, you might handle authorization for a function directly in your backend code:
export
async
function
insertTodo
(newTodo
:
{ newTodo
:
string
; userId
:
string
}) {
const
{
userId
,
getToken
}
=
auth
();
// Gets the user's ID and getToken from the JWT or session
const
authToken
=
await
getToken
();
// Await the getToken function
if
(
!
userId)
throw
new
Error
(
'No user logged in'
);
// No user authenticated
if
(
newTodo
.userId
!==
userId)
throw
new
Error
(
'Unauthorized'
);
// User mismatch
const
db
=
drizzle
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL
!
,
{ schema });
return
db
.$withAuth
(authToken)
.insert
(
schema
.todos)
.values
({
task
:
newTodo
.newTodo
,
isComplete
:
false
,
userId
,
// Explicitly ties todo to the user
});
}
In this case, you have to:
Check if the user is authenticated and their
userId
matches the data they are trying to modify.
Handle both task creation and authorization in the backend code.
After Neon RLS (RLS in the database):
With Neon RLS, you only need to pass the JWT to the database - authorization checks happen automatically through RLS policies:
Drizzle
SQL
pgPolicy
(
'create todos'
,
{
for
:
'insert'
,
to
:
'authenticated'
,
withCheck
:
sql
`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`
,
});
Now, in your backend, you can simplify the logic, removing the user authentication checks and explicit authorization handling.
export
async
function
insertTodo
({ newTodo }
:
{ newTodo
:
string
}) {
const
{
getToken
}
=
auth
();
const
authToken
=
await
getToken
();
const
db
=
drizzle
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_AUTHENTICATED_URL
!
,
{ schema });
return
db
.$withAuth
(authToken)
.insert
(
schema
.todos)
.values
({
task
:
newTodo
,
isComplete
:
false
,
});
}
This approach is flexible: you can manage RLS policies directly in SQL, or use an ORM like Drizzle to centralize them within your schema. Keeping both schema and authorization in one place can make it easier to maintain security. Some ORMs like
Drizzle
are adding support for declaritive RLS, which makes the logic easier to scan and scale.
How Neon RLS gets
auth.user_id()
from the JWT
Let's break down the RLS policy controlling who can
view todos
to see what Neon RLS is actually doing:
Drizzle
SQL
pgPolicy
(
'view todos'
,
{
for
:
'select'
,
to
:
'authenticated'
,
using
:
sql
`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`
,
});
This policy enforces that an authenticated user can only view their own
todos
. Here's how each component works together.
What Neon does for you
When your application makes a request, Neon validates the JWT by checking its signature and expiration date against a public key. Once validated, Neon extracts the
user_id
from the JWT and uses it in the database session, making it accessible for RLS.
How the
pg_session_jwt
extension works
The
pg_session_jwt
extension enables RLS policies to verify user identity directly within SQL queries:
using
:
sql
`(select auth.user_id() = user_id)`
,
auth.user_id()
: This function, provided by
pg_session_jwt
, retrieves the authenticated user's ID from the JWT (it looks for it in the
sub
field).
user_id
: This refers to the
user_id
column in the
todos
table, representing the owner of each to-do item.
The RLS policy compares the
user_id
from the JWT with the
user_id
in the todos table. If they match, the user is allowed to view their own todos; if not, access is denied.
When to rely on RLS
For early-stage applications,
RLS
might offer all the security you need to scale your project. For more mature applications or architectures where multiple backends read from the same database, RLS centralizes authorization rules within the database itself. This way, every service that accesses your database can benefit from secure, consistent access controls without needing to reimplement them individually in each connecting application.
RLS can also act as a backstop or final guarantee to prevent data leaks. Even if other security layers fail — for example, a front-end component exposes access to a part of your app that it shouldn't, or your backend misapplies authorization — RLS ensures that unauthorized users will not be able to interact with your data. In these cases, the exposed action will fail, protecting your sensitive database-backed resources.
Supported providers
Here is a non-exhaustive list of authentication providers. The table shows which providers Neon RLS supports, links out to provider documentation for details, and the discovery URL pattern each provider typically uses.

* If you're using an older Auth0 project, you might encounter
this issue
, resulting in a
jwk not found
error when working with Neon RLS. To fix this, go to your Auth0 tenant settings and rotate your signing keys under the
Signing Keys
tab.
JWT Audience Checks
Neon RLS can also verify the
aud
claim in the JWT. This is useful if you want to restrict access to a specific application or service.
For authentication providers such as Firebase Auth and GCP Cloud Identity, Neon RLS
mandates
the definition of an expected audience. This is because these providers share the same JWKS URL for all of their projects.
The configuration of the expected audience can be done via the Neon RLS UI or via the
Neon RLS API
.
Sample applications
You can use these sample ToDo applications to get started using Neon RLS with popular authentication providers.

Current limitations
While this feature is in its early-access phase, there are some limitations to be aware of:
Authentication provider requirements
:
Your authentication provider must support
Asymmetric Keys
. For example,
Supabase Auth
will not be compatible until asymetric key support is added. You can track progress on this item
here
.
The provider must generate a unique set of public keys for each project and expose those keys via a unique URL for each project.
Connection type
: Your application must use
HTTP
to connect to Neon. At this time,
TCP
and
WebSockets
connections are not supported. This means you need to use the
Neon serverless driver
over HTTP as your Postgres driver.
JWT expiration delay
: After removing an authentication provider from your project, it may take a few minutes for JWTs signed by that provider to stop working.
Algorithm support
: Only JWTs signed with the
ES256
and
RS256
algorithms are supported.
These limitations will evolve as we continue developing the feature. If you have any questions or run into issues, please let us know.

Create a Neon Twin
Learn how to Twin your production database with Neon
Explore our dev/test use case
Move development and testing to Neon—keep production right where it is.
Read more about our dev/test use case
here
.
What is a Neon Twin?
A Neon Twin is a full or partial clone of your production or staging database, providing developers and teams with isolated, sandboxed environments that closely mirror production.
Designed for efficiency
Creating a Neon Twin will streamline development workflows, enhance productivity, and help teams ship faster—all while being more
cost-effective
and easier to manage than traditional development/testing environments.
Automatically synced
The workflows in this section enable automatic synchronization between your production database and your Neon Twin.
Instant Branches
With a Neon Twin created,
branches
can be quickly spun up or torn down, enabling developers to build new features or debug issues—all within their own isolated environments with a dedicated compute resource.
Branches can be created and managed through the
Neon console
or programmatically via the
API
.

Generate synthetic data with Neosync
Learn how to generate synthetic data in your Neon database with Neosync
Neosync
is an open-source synthetic data orchestration platform that can create synthetic data and sync it across all of your Neon database environments.
In this guide, we'll show you how to seed a Neon database with synthetic data for testing and rapid development using Neosync.
Prerequisites
To complete the steps in the guide, you require the following:
A Neon account and project. If you do not have those, see
Sign up
.
A
Neosync
account.
Neon setup
In Neon, we'll create a database for the synthetic data, define a table, and retrieve the database connection string.
Create a database
To create a database, which we'll call
neosync
, perform the following steps:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select your project.
Select
Databases
from the sidebar.
Select the branch where you want to create the database.
Click
New Database
.
Enter a database name (
neosync
), and select a Postgres role to be the database owner.
Click
Create
.
Create a table
Next, we'll create the table for your data.
In the Neon Console, select the
SQL Editor
from the sidebar.
Select the correct branch and the
neosync
database you just created.
Run the following commands to create your schema:
CREATE
EXTENSION
IF
NOT
EXISTS
"uuid-ossp"
;
CREATE
TABLE
public
.users (
id UUID
PRIMARY KEY
,
first_name
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
,
last_name
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
,
email
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
,
age
INTEGER
NOT NULL
);
note
Installing the Postgres UUID extension to auto-generate UUIDs for the
id
column is optional. If you prefer, you can let Neonsync generate the UUIDs column values for you.
Copy the connection string for your database
Navigate to the
Project Dashboard
in Neon, click
Connect
, and copy the connection string for the destination database from the
Connect to your database
modal.
note
Make sure you select the correct database (
neosync
) from the
Database
drop-down menu.
Your connection string should look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neosync?sslmode
=require
Neosync setup
In Neosync, we'll configure a connection to your Neon database and create a job that populates the database with synthetic data.
Configure a connection to the Neon database
Navigate to
Neosync
and login. Go to
Connections
>
New Connection
then click on
Neon
.
Enter a unique name for the connection in the
Connection Name
field. We'll give the connection the following name:
neon-neosync
Paste the Neon database connection string in the
Connection URL
field and click
Test Connection
to verify that the connection works.
Click
Submit
to save the connection configuration.
Generate synthetic data
To generate data, you need to create a
Job
in Neosync:
Click on
Jobs
and then click on
New Job
. You are presented with a few job types. Since you are seeding a table from scratch, select the
Data Generation
option and click
Next
.
Give the job a name and set
Initiate Job Run
to
Yes
. We'll call it
generate-user-data
. You can leave the schedule and advanced options alone. Click
Next
to move onto the
Connect
page.
On the
Connect
page, select the connection you configured previously (
neon-neosync
) from the dropdown and click
Next
.
note
There are a few different options on the
Connect
page, such as
Truncate Before Insert
,
Truncate Cascade
, etc., but we don't need these right now, so you can ignore them.
On the
Schema
page:
Specify a value for
Number of Rows
. We'll create 1000 rows of data to use in this example.
Under
Table Selection
, select the schema and table (
public.users
) where you want to generate synthetic data and move it from the source to the destination table.
For each column in your table, select a
Transfomer
to define the type of data you want to generate for the column. For the
age
column, we used the
Generate Random Int64
to randomly generate ages between 18 and 40. You can configure the generator by clicking on the edit icon next to the transformer and setting min and max values.
After the transformers are configured, select the checkboxes for all of the transformers and click
Submit
to create the
Job
that we defined previously. On the
Job
page, you can see that the job ran successfully, creating 1000 rows of synthetic data to work within just a few seconds.
Verify that the data was created in Neon by navigating to the Neon Console and selecting the
Tables
from the sidebar. Your data should be visible in the
public.users
table.
Conclusion
In this guide, we stepped through how to seed your Neon database using Neosync. This was a minimal example, but you can follow the same steps to generate tens of thousands or more rows of data. The ability to easily generate synthetic data is particularly helpful if you're working on a new application and don't have data yet or want to augment your existing database with more data for performance testing.
Neosync is also able to handle referential integrity in case you need to generate data for tables linked by referential integrity constraints.

Connect a NestJS application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a NestJS application
NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications
1
. This guide explains how to connect NestJS with Neon using a secure server-side request.
To create a Neon project and access it from a NestJS application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a NestJS project and add dependencies
Create a NestJS project if you do not have one. For instructions, see
Quick Start
, in the NestJS documentation.
Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Store your Neon credentials
Add a
.env
file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find your connection details by clicking
Connect
on the Neon
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
DATABASE_URL
=
"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>?sslmode=require"
Configure the Postgres client
1. Create a Database Module
To manage the connection to your Neon database, start by creating a
DatabaseModule
in your NestJS application. This module will handle the configuration and provisioning of the Postgres client.
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ config }
from
'dotenv'
;
import
{ Module }
from
'@nestjs/common'
;
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
// Load Environment Variables
config
({
path
:
[
'.env'
,
'.env.production'
,
'.env.local'
]
,
});
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
dbProvider
=
{
provide
:
'POSTGRES_POOL'
,
useValue
:
sql
,
};
@
Module
({
providers
:
[dbProvider]
,
exports
:
[dbProvider]
,
})
export
class
DatabaseModule
{}
2. Create a Service for Database Interaction
Next, implement a service to facilitate interaction with your Postgres database. This service will use the database connection defined in the DatabaseModule.
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ Injectable
,
Inject }
from
'@nestjs/common'
;
@
Injectable
()
export
class
AppService
{
constructor
(@
Inject
(
'POSTGRES_POOL'
)
private
readonly
sql
:
any
) {}
async
getTable
(name
:
string
)
:
Promise
<
any
[]> {
return
await
this
.sql
(
`SELECT * FROM
${
name
}
`
);
}
}
3. Integrate the Database Module and Service
Import and inject the DatabaseModule and AppService into your AppModule. This ensures that the database connection and services are available throughout your application.
import
{ Module }
from
'@nestjs/common'
;
import
{ AppController }
from
'./app.controller'
;
import
{ AppService }
from
'./app.service'
;
import
{ DatabaseModule }
from
'./database/database.module'
;
@
Module
({
imports
:
[DatabaseModule]
,
controllers
:
[AppController]
,
providers
:
[AppService]
,
})
export
class
AppModule
{}
4. Define a Controller Endpoint
Finally, define a
GET
endpoint in your AppController to fetch data from your Postgres database. This endpoint will use the AppService to query the database.
import
{ Controller
,
Get }
from
'@nestjs/common'
;
import
{ AppService }
from
'./app.service'
;
@
Controller
(
'/'
)
export
class
AppController
{
constructor
(
private
readonly
appService
:
AppService
) {}
@
Get
()
async
getTable
() {
return
this
.
appService
.getTable
(
'playing_with_neon'
);
}
}
Run the app
When you run
npm run start
you can expect to see output similar to the following at
localhost:3000
:
[{
"id"
:1,
"name"
:
"c4ca4238a0"
,
"value"
:0.39330545},{
"id"
:2,
"name"
:
"c81e728d9d"
,
"value"
:0.14468245}]

Use Neon with Netlify Functions
Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Netlify Functions application
Netlify Functions
provide a serverless execution environment for building and deploying backend functionality without managing server infrastructure. It's integrated with Netlify's ecosystem, making it ideal for augmenting web applications with server-side logic, API integrations, and data processing tasks in a scalable way.
This guide will show you how to connect to a Neon Postgres database from your Netlify Functions project. We'll use the
Neon serverless driver
to connect to the database and make queries.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A Netlify account for deploying your site with
Functions
. Sign up at
Netlify
if necessary. While Netlify can deploy directly from a GitHub repository, we'll use the
Netlify
CLI tool to deploy our project manually.
Node.js
and
npm
installed locally for developing and deploying your Functions.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
After logging into the Neon Console, proceed to the
Projects
section.
Click
New Project
to start a new one.
In the Neon
Dashboard
, use the
SQL Editor
from the sidebar to execute the SQL command below, creating a new table for coffee blends:
CREATE
TABLE
favorite_coffee_blends
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
,
origin
TEXT
,
notes
TEXT
);
Populate the table with some initial data:
INSERT INTO
favorite_coffee_blends (
name
, origin, notes)
VALUES
(
'Morning Joy'
,
'Ethiopia'
,
'Citrus, Honey, Floral'
),
(
'Dark Roast Delight'
,
'Colombia'
,
'Rich, Chocolate, Nutty'
),
(
'Arabica Aroma'
,
'Brazil'
,
'Smooth, Caramel, Fruity'
),
(
'Robusta Revolution'
,
'Vietnam'
,
'Strong, Bold, Bitter'
);
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your Neon database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Setting up your Netlify Functions project
We'll use the Netlify CLI to create a new project and add functions to it. To install the CLI, run:
npm
install
netlify-cli
-g
To authenticate the CLI with your Netlify account, run:
netlify
login
This command opens a browser window to authenticate your terminal session with Netlify. After logging in, you can close the browser window and interact with your Netlify account from the terminal.
Create a new Netlify project
We will create a simple HTML webpage that fetches the coffee blends from the Neon database using a Netlify Function and displays them. To create a new
Netlify Site
project, run:
mkdir
neon-netlify-example
&&
cd
neon-netlify-example
netlify
sites:create
You will be prompted to select a team and site name. Choose a unique name for your site. This command then links the current directory to a
Site
project in your Netlify account.
❯
netlify
sites:create
?
Team: Ishan Anand’s team
?
Site name (
leave
blank
for
a
random
name

Site
ID:
ed43ba05-ff6e-40a9-9a68-8f58b9ad9937
Linked
to
neon-netlify-example
Implement the function
We'll create a new function to fetch the coffee blends from the Neon database. To set up the function entrypoint script, you can run the command below and use the settings provided:
❯
netlify
functions:create
get_coffee_blends
?
Select the type of
function
you
'd like to create Serverless function (Node/Go/Rust)
? Select the language of your function JavaScript
? Pick a template javascript-hello-world
◈ Creating function get_coffee_blends
◈ Created ./netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.js
Function created!
This command creates a new directory
netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends
with a
get_coffee_blends.js
file inside it. We are using the ES6
import
syntax to implement the request handler, so we will change the script extension to
.mjs
for the runtime to recognize it.
We also install the
Neon serverless
driver as a dependency to connect to the Neon database and fetch the data.
mv
netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.js
netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.mjs
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Now, replace the contents of the function script with the following code:
// netlify/functions/get_coffee_blends/get_coffee_blends.mjs
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
export
async
function
handler
(event) {
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
try
{
const
rows
=
await
sql
(
'SELECT * FROM favorite_coffee_blends;'
);
return
{
statusCode
:
200
,
body
:
JSON
.stringify
(rows)
,
};
}
catch
(error) {
return
{
statusCode
:
500
,
body
:
JSON
.stringify
({ error
:
error
.message })
,
};
}
}
This function connects to your Neon database and fetches the list of your favorite coffee blends.
Implement the frontend
To make use of the
Function
implemented above, we will create a simple HTML page that fetches and displays the coffee information by calling the function.
Create a new file
index.html
at the root of your project with the following content:
<!
doctype
html
>
<
html
>
<
head
>
<

.appendChild
(li);
});
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Error:'
,
error);
}
})();
</
script
>
</
body
>
</
html
>
Test the site locally
Set the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable in a
.env
file at the root of your project:
DATABASE_URL=YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING
We are now ready to test our Netlify site project locally. Run the following command to start a local development server:
netlify
dev
The Netlify CLI will print the local server URL where your site is running. Open the URL in your browser to see the coffee blends fetched from your Neon database.
Deploying your Netlify Site and Function
Deploying is straightforward with the Netlify CLI. However, we need to set the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable for the Netlify deployed site too. You can use the CLI to set it.
netlify
env:set
DATABASE_URL
"YOUR_NEON_CONNECTION_STRING"
Now, to deploy your site and function, run the following command. When asked to provide a publish directory, enter
.
to deploy the entire project.
netlify
deploy
--prod
The CLI will build and deploy your site and functions to Netlify. After deployment, Netlify provides a URL for your live function. Navigate to the URL in your browser to check that the deployment was successful.
Removing the example application and Neon project
For cleanup, delete your Netlify site and functions via the Netlify dashboard or CLI. Consult the
Netlify documentation
for detailed instructions.
To remove your Neon project, follow the deletion steps in Neon's documentation under
Manage Projects
.

Connect a Next.js application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Next.js application
Next.js by Vercel is an open-source web development framework that enables React-based web applications. This topic describes how to create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application.
To create a Neon project and access it from a Next.js application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a Next.js project and add dependencies
Create a Next.js project if you do not have one. For instructions, see
Create a Next.js App
, in the Vercel documentation.
Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Store your Neon credentials
Add a
.env
file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find your Neon database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
DATABASE_URL
=
"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>?sslmode=require"
Configure the Postgres client
There are multiple ways to make server side requests with Next.js. See below for the different implementations.
App Router
There are two methods for fetching and mutating data using server-side requests in Next.js App Router, they are:
Server Components
fetches data at runtime on the server.
Server Actions
functions executed on the server to perform data mutations.
Server Components
In your server components using the App Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
async
function
getData
() {
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
response
=
await
sql
`SELECT version()`
;
return
response[
0
].version;
}
export
default
async
function
Page
() {
const
data
=
await
getData
();
return
<>{data}</>;
}
Server Actions
In your server actions using the App Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
export
default
async
function
Page
() {
async
function
create
(formData
:
FormData
) {
"use server"
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
await
sql
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (comment TEXT)`
;
const
comment
=
formData
.get
(
"comment"
);
await
sql
(
"INSERT INTO comments (comment) VALUES ($1)"
,
[comment]);
}
return
(
<
form
action
=
{create}>
<
input
type
=
"text"
placeholder
=
"write a comment"
name
=
"comment"
/>
<
button
type
=
"submit"
>Submit</
button
>
</
form
>
);
}
Pages Router
There are two methods for fetching data using server-side requests in Next.js Pages Router, they are:
getServerSideProps
fetches data at runtime so that content is always fresh.
getStaticProps
pre-renders pages at build time for data that is static or changes infrequently.
getServerSideProps
From
getServerSideProps
using the Pages Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
export
async
function
getServerSideProps
() {
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
response
=
await
sql
`SELECT version()`
;
return
{ props
:
{ data
:
response[
0
].version } };
}
export
default
function
Page
({ data }) {
return
<>{data}</>;
}
getStaticProps
From
getStaticProps
using the Pages Router, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
export
async
function
getStaticProps
() {
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
response
=
await
sql
`SELECT version()`
;
return
{ props
:
{ data
:
response[
0
].version } };
}
export
default
function
Page
({ data }) {
return
<>{data}</>;
}
Serverless Functions
From your Serverless Functions, add the following code snippet to connect to your Neon database:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
export
default
async
function
handler
(req
,
res) {
const
response
=
await
sql
`SELECT version()`
;
const
{
version
}
=
response[
0
];
res
.status
(
200
)
.json
({ version });
}
Edge Functions
From your Edge Functions, add the following code snippet and connect to your Neon database using the
Neon serverless driver
:
export
const
config
=
{
runtime
:
'edge'
,
};
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
export
default
async
function
handler
(req
,
res) {
const
response
=
await
sql
`SELECT version()`
;
const
{
version
}
=
response[
0
];
return
Response
.json

Where to upload and serve files?
Neon does not provide a built-in file storage service. For managing binary file data (blobs), we recommend a pattern that leverages dedicated, specialized storage services. Follow our guide on
File Storage
to learn more about how to store files in external object storage and file management services and track metadata in Neon.

Connect Nuxt to Postgres on Neon
Learn how to make server-side queries to Postgres using Nitro API routes
Nuxt
is an open-source full-stack meta framework that enables Vue-based web applications. This topic describes how to connect a Nuxt application to a Postgres database on Neon.
To create a Neon project and access it from a Nuxt.js application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click

Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a Nuxt project and add dependencies
Create a Nuxt project if you do not have one. For instructions, see
Create a Nuxt Project
, in the Nuxt documentation.
Add project dependencies using one of the following commands:
Neon serverless driver
postgres.js
node-postgres
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
Store your Neon credentials
Add a
.env
file to your project directory and add your Neon connection string to it. You can find your connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
to open the
Connect to your database
modal. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
NUXT_DATABASE_URL
=
"postgresql://<user>:<password>@<endpoint_hostname>.neon.tech:<port>/<dbname>?sslmode=require"
Configure the Postgres client
First, make sure you load the
NUXT_DATABASE_URL
from your .env file in Nuxt’s runtime configuration:
In
nuxt.config.js
:
export
default
defineNuxtConfig
({
runtimeConfig
:
{
databaseUrl
:
‘’
,
}
,
});
Next, use the Neon serverless driver to create a database connection. Here’s an example configuration:
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
export
default
defineCachedEventHandler
(
async
(event)
=>
{
const
{
databaseUrl
}
=
useRuntimeConfig
();
const
db
=
neon
(databaseUrl);
const
result
=
await
db
`SELECT version()`
;
return
result;
}
,
{
maxAge
:
60
*
60
*
24
,
// cache it for a day
}
);
note
This example demonstrates using the Neon serverless driver to run a simple query. The
useRuntimeConfig
method accesses the
databaseUrl
set in your Nuxt runtime configuration.
Async Handling: Make sure the handler is async if you are awaiting the database query result.
Make sure
maxAge
caching fits your application’s needs. In this example, it’s set to cache results for a day. Adjust as necessary.
Run the app
When you run
npm run dev
you can expect to see the following on
localhost:3000
:

Neon OAuth integration
You can integrate your application or service with Neon using OAuth. The Neon OAuth integration enables your application to interact with Neon user accounts, carrying out permitted actions on their behalf. Our integration does not require direct access to user login credentials and is conducted with their approval, ensuring data privacy and security.
To set up the integration and create a Neon OAuth application, you can apply on our
Partners page
. You will need to provide the following information:
Your name and email address (this should be an individual email address, not a shared inbox address)
Your company name
Details about your application, including your application name, what it does, and a link to the website.
Callback URL(s), which are used to redirect users after completing the authorization flow.
https://app.company.com/api/integrations/neon/callback
https://app.stage.company.com/api/integrations/neon/callback
http://localhost:3000/api/integrations/neon/callback
Required scopes, defining the type of access you need. We provide scopes for managing both projects and organizations. For a list of all available scopes, see
Supported OAuth Scopes
.
Whether or not you will make API calls from a backend.
A logo to be displayed on Neon's OAuth consent dialog when users authorize your application to access their Neon account.
After your application is reviewed, Neon will provide you with a
client ID
and, if applicable, a
client secret
. Client secrets are only provided for backend clients, so non-backend applications (e.g. browser-based apps or CLI tools) will not receive a secret. These credentials are sensitive and should be stored securely.
How the OAuth integration works
Here is a high-level overview of how Neon's OAuth implementation works:
The user sends a request to your API endpoint to initiate the OAuth flow by clicking a button or link in your application.
An authorization URL is generated.
The user is redirected to Neon’s OAuth consent screen to authorize the application.
The user logs in and authorizes the application, granting it the necessary permissions.
A redirect is performed to a callback endpoint, which includes an access token that allows the application to manage Neon resources on the user’s behalf.
About the Neon OAuth server
The Neon OAuth server implements the OpenID Connect protocol and supports
OpenID Connect Discovery specification
. The server metadata is published at the following well-known URL:
https://oauth2.neon.tech/.well-known/openid-configuration
.
Here is an example response:

}
note
You must add
offline
and
offline_access
scopes to your request to receive the
refresh_token
.
Depending on the OpenID client you’re using, you might not need to explicitly interact with the API endpoints listed below. OAuth 2.0 clients typically handle this interaction automatically. For example, the
Neon CLI
, written in Typescript, interacts with the API endpoints automatically to retrieve the
refresh_token
and
access_token
. For an example, refer to this part of the Neon CLI
source code
. In this example, the
oauthHost
is
https://oauth2.neon.tech
.
Supported OAuth Scopes
The following OAuth scopes allow varying degrees of access to Neon resources:
Project scopes
Scope Name
Create Projects
urn:neoncloud:projects:create
Read Projects
urn:neoncloud:projects:read
Modify Projects
urn:neoncloud:projects:update
Delete Projects
urn:neoncloud:projects:delete
Manage Projects
urn:neoncloud:projects:permission
Organization scopes
Scope Name
Create Organizations
urn:neoncloud:orgs:create
Read Organizations
urn:neoncloud:orgs:read
Update Organizations
urn:neoncloud:orgs:update
Delete Organizations
urn:neoncloud:orgs:delete
Manage Organization Permissions
urn:neoncloud:orgs:permission
You must choose from these predefined scopes when requesting access; custom scopes are not supported.
Let's now go through the full flow, step by step:
Initiating the OAuth flow
To initiate the OAuth flow, you need to generate an authorization URL. You can do that by directing your users to
https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth
while passing the following query parameters:
client_id
: your OAuth application's ID (provided to you by Neon after your application is received)
redirect_uri
: the full URL that Neon should redirect users to after authorizing your application. The URL should match at least one of the callback URLs you provided when applying to become a partner.
scope
: This is a space-separated list of predefined scopes that define the level of access you want to request. For a full list of supported scopes and their meanings, see the
Supported OAuth Scopes
section.
Example:
urn:neoncloud:projects:create urn:neoncloud:projects:read urn:neoncloud:projects:update urn:neoncloud:projects:delete urn:neoncloud:orgs:read
response_type
: This should be set to
code
to indicate that you are using the
Authorization Code grant type
.
code_challenge
: This is a random string that is used to verify the integrity of the authorization code.
state
: This is a random string that is returned to your callback URL. You can use this parameter to verify that the request came from your application and not from a third party.
Authorization URL
Here is an example of what the authorization URL might look like:
https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/auth?client_id=neon-experimental&scope=openid%20offline%20offline_access%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Acreate%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Aread%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Aupdate%20urn%3Aneoncloud%3Aprojects%3Adelete&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fneon&grant_type=authorization_code&state=H58y-rSTebc3QmNbRjNTX9dL73-IyoU2T_WNievO9as&code_challenge=99XcbwOFU6iEsvXr77Xxwsk9I0GL4c4c4Q8yPIVrF_0&code_challenge_method=S256
OAuth consent screen
After being redirected to the authorization URL, the user is presented with Neon's OAuth consent screen, which is pre-populated with the scopes you requested. From the consent screen, the user is able to review the scopes and authorize the application to connect their Neon account.
note
The
Neon API
provides a
Get current user details
endpoint for retrieving information about the currently authorized Neon user.
Authorization code is returned to your callback URL
After successfully completing the authorization flow, the user is redirected to the callback URL with the following query parameters appended to the URL:
code
: an authorization code that will be exchanged for an access token
scope
: the scopes that the user authorized your application to access
state
: you can compare the value of this parameter with the original
state
you provided in the previous step to ensure that the request came from your application and not from a third party
Exchanging the authorization code for an access token
You can now exchange the authorization code returned from the previous step for an access token. To do that, you need to send a
POST
request to
https://oauth2.neon.tech/oauth2/token
with the following parameters:
client_id
: your OAuth application's ID.
redirect_uri
: the full URL that Neon should redirect users to after authorizing your application. The URL should match at least one of the callback URLs you provided when applying to become a partner.
client_secret
: your OAuth application's secret
grant_type
: set this to
authorization_code
to indicate that you are using the
Authorization Code grant type
code
: the authorization code returned from the previous step
The response object includes an
access_token
value, required for making requests to the
Neon API
on your users' behalf. This value must be supplied in the Authorization header of the HTTP request when sending requests to the Neon API.
Example OAuth applications
For an example application that leverages the Neon OAuth integration, see the
Visualizing Neon Database Branches
application. You can find the application code on GitHub.

What is PostgREST?
PostgREST is a standalone web server that automatically turns your PostgreSQL database schema into a RESTful API. It uses the database's structure, constraints, and permissions to create API endpoints without requiring you to write any backend code. The API follows REST conventions and supports full CRUD operations, filtering, pagination, and even complex joins.
This guide shows you how to set up PostgREST with a Neon Postgres database using Docker for local development. You'll learn how to configure basic read access, add authenticated endpoints with JWT tokens, and implement row-level security for fine-grained access control.
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Set up your database
From the
Neon SQL Editor
or any SQL client such as
psql
, set up your database using the following queries:
CREATE
SCHEMA
api
;
CREATE
TABLE
api
.students (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
first_name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
last_name
TEXT
NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO
api.students (first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(
'Ada'
,
'Lovelace'
),
(
'Alan'
,
'Turing'
);
CREATE
ROLE
anonymous
NOLOGIN;
GRANT
anonymous
TO
neondb_owner;
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
api
TO
anonymous
;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
api
TO
anonymous
;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
api
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
anonymous
;
tip
While this example uses SERIAL for simplicity, consider using UUID as a primary key in production systems—especially in distributed environments, when exposing identifiers in URLs, or when avoiding predictable sequences is important.
Copy your database connection string
Retrieve an unpooled database connection string — PostgREST requires a direct connection to your database.
Navigate to your
Project Dashboard
in the Neon Console.
Click the
Connect
button to open the
Connect to your database modal
.
Toggle
Connection pooling
to disable it — you need an unpooled connection string.
Copy the connection string.
Run PostgREST
Use Docker to run PostgREST locally, specifying the
unpooled
database connection string.
Linux
macOS
Windows
docker
run
--rm
--net=host
\
-e
PGRST_DB_URI=
"<non-pooled-connection-string-from-neon-console>"
\
-e
PGRST_DB_SCHEMA=
"api"
\
-e
PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE=
"anonymous"
\
postgrest/postgrest
Once running, visit
http://localhost:3000/students
to confirm the API is working. You should see the following records in your browser:
Add authenticated access
To support full CRUD operations (inserts, updates, and deletes), you need to set up permissions in your database by creating a role for authenticated users. Here, we create an
authenticated
role, assign privileges, and grant the role to our database owner (
neondb_owner
). Run these commands from the Neon SQL Editor or an SQL client.
CREATE
ROLE
authenticated NOLOGIN;
GRANT
authenticated
TO
neondb_owner;
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
api
TO
authenticated;
GRANT
ALL
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
api
TO
authenticated;
GRANT
USAGE,
SELECT
ON
ALL SEQUENCES
IN
SCHEMA
api
TO
authenticated;
Run PostgREST with a JWT secret
Run PostgREST again, this time with a JWT secret that will be used by PostgREST to verify the JWT that we will attach to our requests in a later step.
Linux
macOS
Windows
docker
run
--rm
--net=host
\
-e
PGRST_DB_URI=
"<non-pooled-connection-string-from-neon-console>"
\
-e
PGRST_DB_SCHEMA=
"api"
\
-e
PGRST_JWT_SECRET=
"reallyreallyreallyreallyverysafe"
\
-e
PGRST_DB_ANON_ROLE=
"anonymous"
\
postgrest/postgrest
Authenticate requests using JWT
Now that we have defined our JWT secret above (
reallyreallyreallyreallyverysafe
), we'll create a sample JWT that's signed with this secret. If you didn't change the secret used above, you can use this JWT:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCJ9.XOGSeHS8usEzEELkUl8SWOrsOLP7xWmHckRSTgpyP3o
tip
You can use
jwt.io
to generate your own JWT. Make sure to use the
HS256
algorithm.
Now let's test different CRUD operations using standard HTTP methods. Notice that we've attached the JWT in the
Authorization
header as a bearer token.
Insert a student:
curl
http://localhost:3000/students
\
-X
POST
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCJ9.XOGSeHS8usEzEELkUl8SWOrsOLP7xWmHckRSTgpyP3o"
\
-d
'{"first_name": "Grace", "last_name": "Hopper"}'
You should see the following records after refreshing your browser:
Update a student:
curl
"http://localhost:3000/students?id=eq.1"
\
-X
PATCH
\
-H
"Content-Type: application/json"
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCJ9.XOGSeHS8usEzEELkUl8SWOrsOLP7xWmHckRSTgpyP3o"
\
-d
'{"first_name": "Ada I.", "last_name": "Lovelace"}'
Refresh your browser to see the updated records:
Delete a student:
curl
"http://localhost:3000/students?id=eq.3"
\
-X
DELETE
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCJ9.XOGSeHS8usEzEELkUl8SWOrsOLP7xWmHckRSTgpyP3o"
You should now see these records:
Use Row-Level Security (RLS)
PostgREST supports Postgres RLS for fine-grained access control. Here's an example policy to restrict access to a user's own records. Run these statements on your database in the Neon SQL Editor or an SQL client.
ALTER
TABLE
api.students
ENABLE
ROW
LEVEL
SECURITY
;
CREATE
POLICY
students_policy
ON
api.students
FOR
ALL
TO
authenticated
USING
(id
=
(
SELECT
current_setting(
'request.jwt.claims'
, true)::
json->>
'sub'
)::
integer
)
WITH
CHECK
(id
=
(
SELECT
current_setting(
'request.jwt.claims'
, true)::
json->>
'sub'
)::
integer
);
The JWT token used in the CRUD examples above contains a payload with
{"role": "authenticated"}
, which tells PostgREST to use the
authenticated
role for those requests.
In a real application, you would want to:
Generate tokens with proper expiration times
Include user-specific claims in the JWT (most likely, a "sub" field which corresponds to users' IDs)
Implement a proper authentication server/service (or use a third-party managed auth provider)
Now let's test this with a JWT that includes a user ID. We'll create a new JWT with a payload that includes a user ID in the "sub" claim:
Now, let's generate a new JWT that has the following payload defining the student ID (and sign it with the same JWT secret from above):
{
"role"
:
"authenticated"
,
"sub"
:
"1"
Here's the new token:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCIsInN1YiI6IjEifQ.U_EgeU0y0pAM5cTsMXndJe_cR1vG5Vf9dq4DkqfMAxs
Now, run this command with the new token:
$
curl
"http://localhost:3000/students"
-H
"Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCIsInN1YiI6IjEifQ.U_EgeU0y0pAM5cTsMXndJe_cR1vG5Vf9dq4DkqfMAxs"
[{
"id"
:1,
"first_name"
:
"Ada I."
,
"last_name"
:
"Lovelace"
}]
Because the
students
table has a RLS policy attached to the student's ID, the student can only view their own records.
Summary
The examples shown above are simple, but they illustrate how PostgREST works. With Neon and PostgREST, you can instantly turn your Postgres database into a REST API—no backend code required. This setup is ideal for rapid prototyping, internal tools, or even production workloads where you want to focus on your data and business logic rather than boilerplate API code.
Next steps
Now that you have a basic PostgREST API running with Neon, here are some things you can try next:

filtering
,
ordering
, and
pagination
in your API requests

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Prisma ORM
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Javascript project using Prisma ORM
Prisma
is an open-source ORM for Node.js and Typescript, known for its ease of use and focus on type safety. It supports many databases, including Postgres, and provides a robust system for managing database schemas and migrations.
This guide walks you through using
Prisma
ORM with a
Neon
Postgres database in a Javascript project. We'll create a Node.js application, set up Prisma, and show how to run migrations using Prisma.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select an existing project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find your Neon database connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Setting Up the Node application
Create a new Node project
We'll create a simple catalog, with API endpoints that query the database for authors and a list of their books. Run the following command in your terminal to set up a new project using
Express.js
:
mkdir
neon-prisma-guide
&&
cd
neon-prisma-guide
npm
init
-y
&&
touch
.env
index.js
npm
pkg
set
type=
"module"
&&
npm
pkg
set
scripts.start=
"node index.js"
npm
install
express
To use the Prisma ORM for making queries, install the
@prisma/client
package and the Prisma CLI. The CLI is only needed as a development dependency to generate the Prisma Client for the given schema.
npm
install
@prisma/client
&&
npm
install
prisma
--save-dev
npx
prisma
init
These commands create a new
prisma
folder in your project with a
schema.prisma
file, where we will define the database schema for our application.
Configure Prisma to Use Neon Database
Open the
prisma/schema.prisma
file and update the
datasource db
block with your Neon database connection details:
datasource
db
{
provider
=
"postgresql"
url
=
env
(
"DATABASE_URL"
)
}
Add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to your
.env
file, which you'll use to connect to your Neon database. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon Console earlier:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
Define the Database schema
In the
prisma/schema.prisma
file, add the following model definitions:
model
Author
{
@@map
(
"authors"
)
id
Int
@id
@default
(
autoincrement
())
name
String
bio
String
?
createdAt
DateTime
@default
(
now
())
@map
(
"created_at"
)
books     Book
[]
}
model
Book
{
@@map
(
"books"
)
id
Int
@id
@default
(
autoincrement
())
title
String
authorId
Int
@map
(
"author_id"
)
createdAt
DateTime

())
@map
(
"created_at"
)
author    Author
@relation
(fields: [
authorId
], references: [

}
Two models are defined above:
Author
, which contains information about authors, and
Book
, for details about published books. The
Book
model includes a foreign key that references the
Author
model.
Generate Prisma client and run migrations
To create and apply migrations based on your schema, run the following command in the terminal:
npx
prisma
migrate
dev
--name
init
This command generates migration files written in SQL corresponding to our schema definitions and applies them to create the tables in your Neon database. We used the
--name
flag to name the migration.
The command also generates a Prisma Client that is aware of our schemas:
import
{ PrismaClient }
from
'@prisma/client'
;
const
prisma
=
new
PrismaClient
();
We'll use this client later to interact with the database.
Seed the Database
To test that the application works, we need to add some example data to our tables. Create a
seed.js
file in your project and add the following code to it:
// seed.js
import
{ PrismaClient }
from
'@prisma/client'
;
const
prisma
=
new
PrismaClient
();
const
seed
=
async
()
=>
{
const
authors
=
[
{
name
:
'J.R.R. Tolkien'
,
bio
:
'The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings.'
,
books
:
{
create
:
[
{ title
:
'The Hobbit'
}
,
{ title
:
'The Fellowship of the Ring'
}
,
{ title
:
'The Two Towers'
}
,
{ title
:
'The Return of the King'
}
,
]
,
}
,
}
,
{
name
:
'George R.R. Martin'
,
bio
:
'The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.'
,
books
:
{
create
:
[{ title
:
'A Game of Thrones'
}
,
{ title
:
'A Clash of Kings'
}]
,
}
,
}
,
{
name
:
'J.K. Rowling'
,
bio
:
'The creator of the Harry Potter series.'
,
books
:
{
create
:
[
{ title
:
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"
}
,
{ title
:
'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'
}
,
]
,
}
,
}
,
];
for
(
const
author
of
authors) {
await
prisma
.
author
.create
({
data
:
author
,
});
}
};
async
function
main
() {
try
{
await
seed
();
console
.log
(
'Seeding completed'
);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Error during seeding:'
,
error);
process
.exit
(
1
);
}
finally
{
await
prisma
.$disconnect
();
}
}
main
();
Run the seed script to populate the database with the initial data:
node
seed.js
You should see the
Seeding completed
message in the terminal, indicating that the seed data was inserted into the database.
Implementing the API Endpoints
Now that the database is set up and populated with data, we can implement the API to query the authors and their books. We'll use
Express
, which is a minimal web application framework for Node.js.
Create an
index.ts
file at the project root, and add the following code to set up your Express server:
import
express
from
'express'
;
import
{ PrismaClient }
from
'@prisma/client'
;
const
prisma
=
new
PrismaClient
();
const
app
=
express
();
const
port
=
process
.
env
.
PORT
||
3000
;
app
.get
(
'/'
,
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
res
.send
(
'Hello World! This is a book catalog.'
);
});
app
.get
(
'/authors'
,
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
const
authors
=
await
prisma
.
author
.findMany
();
res
.json
(authors);
});
app
.get
(
'/books/:author_id'
,
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
const
authorId
=
parseInt
(
req
.
params
.author_id);
const
books
=
await
prisma
.
book
.findMany
({
where
:
{
authorId
:
authorId
,
}
,
});
res
.json
(books);
});
// Start the server
app
.listen
(port
,
()
=>
{
console
.log
(
`Server running on http://localhost:
${
port
}
`
);
});
This code sets up a simple API with two endpoints:
/authors
and
/books/:authorId
. The
/authors
endpoint returns a list of all the authors, and the
/books/:authorId
endpoint returns a list of books written by the specific author with the given
authorId
.
Run the application using the following command:
npm
run
start
This will start the server at
http://localhost:3000
. Navigate to
http://localhost:3000/authors
and
http://localhost:3000/books/1
in your browser to check that the API works as expected.
Migration after a schema change
To demonstrate how to execute a schema change, we'll add a new column to the
authors
table, listing the country of origin for each author.
Update the Prisma model
Modify the
Author
model in the
prisma/schema.prisma
file to add the new
country
field:
model
Author
{
@@map
(
"authors"
)
id
Int
@id
@default
(
autoincrement
())
name
String
bio
String
?
country
String
?
createdAt
DateTime
@default
(
now
())
@map
(
"created_at"
)
books     Book
[]
}
Generate and apply the migration
Run the following command to generate a new migration and apply it to the database:
npx
prisma
migrate
dev
--name
add-country
This command generates a new migration file to add the new field and applies it to the database. It also updates the Prisma client to reflect the change in the schema.
Verify the migration
To verify the migration, run the application again:
npm
run
start
You can navigate to
http://localhost:3000/authors
in your browser to check that each author entry has a
country
field, currently set to
null
.
Conclusion
In this guide, we set up a new Javascript project using
Express.js
and
Prisma
ORM and connected it to a
Neon
Postgres database. We created a schema for the database, generated and ran migrations, and implemented API endpoints to query the database.

Connect from Prisma to Neon
Learn how to connect to Neon from Prisma
Prisma is an open-source, next-generation ORM that lets you to manage and interact with your database. This guide covers the following topics:
Connect to Neon from Prisma
Use connection pooling with Prisma
Use the Neon serverless driver with Prisma
Connection timeouts
Connection pool timeouts
JSON protocol for large Prisma schemas
Connect to Neon from Prisma
To establish a basic connection from Prisma to Neon, perform the following steps:
Retrieve your Neon connection string. You can find it by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.
Add the following lines to your
prisma/schema.prisma
file to identify the data source and database URL:
datasource db {
provider
=
"postgresql"
url
=
env
(
"DATABASE_URL"
)
}
Add a
DATABASE_URL
variable to your
.env
file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding
?sslmode=require
to the end of the connection string to ensure a
secure connection
.
Your setting will appear similar to the following:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
important
If you plan to use Prisma Client from a serverless function, see
Use connection pooling with Prisma
for additional configuration instructions. To adjust your connection string to avoid connection timeout issues, see
Connection timeouts
.
Use connection pooling with Prisma
Serverless functions can require a large number of database connections as demand increases. If you use serverless functions in your application, we recommend that you use a pooled Neon connection string, as shown:
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL=
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
A pooled Neon connection string adds
-pooler
to the endpoint ID, which tells Neon to use a pooled connection. You can add
-pooler
to your connection string manually or copy a pooled connection string from
Connect to your database
modal — click
Connect
on your Project Dashboard to open the modal.
Connection pooling with Prisma Migrate
Prior to Prisma ORM 5.10, attempting to run Prisma Migrate commands, such as
prisma migrate dev
, with a pooled connection caused the following error:
Error undefined: Database error
Error querying the database: db error: ERROR: prepared statement
"s0" already exists
To avoid this issue, you can define a direct connection to the database for Prisma Migrate or you can upgrade Prisma ORM to 5.10 or higher.
Using a direct connection to the database
You can configure a direct connection while allowing applications to use Prisma Client with a pooled connection by adding a
directUrl
property to the datasource block in your
schema.prisma
file. For example:
datasource db {
provider
=
"postgresql"
url
=
env
(
"DATABASE_URL"
)
directUrl
=
env
(
"DIRECT_URL"
)
}
note
The
directUrl
property is available in Prisma version
4.10.0
and higher. For more information about this property, refer to the
Prisma schema reference
.
After adding the
directUrl
property to your
schema.prisma
file, update the
DATABASE_URL
and
DIRECT_URL
variables settings in your
.env
file:
Set
DATABASE_URL
to the pooled connection string for your Neon database. Applications that require a pooled connection should use this connection.
Set
DIRECT_URL
to the direct (non-pooled) connection string. This is the direct connection to the database required by Prisma Migrate. Other Prisma CLI operations may also require a direct connection.
When you finish updating your
.env
file, your variable settings should appear similar to the following:
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL=
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
# Unpooled Neon connection string
DIRECT_URL=
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
Using a pooled connection with Prisma Migrate
With Prisma ORM 5.10 or higher, you can use a pooled Neon connection string with Prisma Migrate. In this case, you only need to define the pooled connection string in your
schema.prisma
file. Adding a
directUrl
property to the datasource block in your
schema.prisma
file and defining a
DIRECT_URL
setting in your environment file are not required. Your complete configuration will look like this:
schema.prisma
file:
datasource db {
provider
=
"postgresql"
url
=
env
(
"DATABASE_URL"
)
}
.env
file:
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL=
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
Use the Neon serverless driver with Prisma
The Neon serverless driver is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that lets you query data from serverless and edge environments. For more information about the driver, see
Neon serverless driver
.
To set up Prisma with the Neon serverless driver, use the Prisma driver adapter. This adapter allows you to choose a different database driver than Prisma's default driver for communicating with your database.
The Prisma driver adapter feature is available in
Preview
in Prisma version 5.4.2 and later.
To get started, enable the
driverAdapters
Preview feature flag in your
schema.prisma
file, as shown:
generator client {
provider
=
"prisma-client-js"
previewFeatures
=
[
"driverAdapters"
]
}
datasource db {
provider
=
"postgresql"
url
=
env
(
"DATABASE_URL"
)
}
Next, generate the Prisma Client:
npx
prisma
generate
Install the Prisma adapter for Neon, the Neon serverless driver, and
ws
packages:
npm
install
ws
@prisma/adapter-neon
@neondatabase/serverless
npm
install
-D
@types/ws
Update your Prisma Client instance:
import
'dotenv/config'
;
import
{ PrismaClient }
from
'@prisma/client'
;
import
{ PrismaNeon }
from
'@prisma/adapter-neon'
;
import
{ neonConfig }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
ws
from
'ws'
;
neonConfig
.webSocketConstructor
=
ws;
// To work in edge environments (Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge, etc.), enable querying over fetch
// neonConfig.poolQueryViaFetch = true
// Type definitions
// declare global {
//   var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
// }
const
connectionString
=
`
${
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
}
`
;
const
adapter
=
new
PrismaNeon
({ connectionString });
const
prisma
=
global
.prisma
||
new
PrismaClient
({ adapter });
if
(
process
.
env
.
NODE_ENV
===
'development'
)
global
.prisma
=
prisma;
export
default
prisma;
You can now use Prisma Client as you normally would with full type-safety. Prisma Migrate, introspection, and Prisma Studio will continue working as before, using the Neon connection string defined by the
DATABASE_URL
variable in your
schema.prisma
file.
note
If you encounter a
TypeError: bufferUtil.mask is not a function
error when building your application, this is likely due to a missing dependency that the
ws
module requires when using
Client
and
Pool
constructs. You can address this requirement by installing the
bufferutil
package:
npm
i
-D
bufferutil
Connection timeouts
A connection timeout that occurs when connecting from Prisma to Neon causes an error similar to the following:
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
This error most likely means that the Prisma query engine timed out before the Neon compute was activated.
A Neon compute has two main states:
Active
and
Idle
. Active means that the compute is currently running. If there is no query activity for 5 minutes, Neon places a compute into an idle state by default.
When you connect to an idle compute from Prisma, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds but added latency can result in a connection timeout. To address this issue, you can adjust your Neon connection string by adding a
connect_timeout
parameter. This parameter defines the maximum number of seconds to wait for a new connection to be opened. The default value is 5 seconds. A higher setting may provide the time required to avoid connection timeouts. For example:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10"
note
A
connect_timeout
setting of 0 means no timeout.
Connection pool timeouts
Another possible cause of timeouts is
Prisma's connection pool
. The Prisma query engine manages a pool of connections. The pool is instantiated when a Prisma Client opens a first connection to the database. For an explanation of how this connection pool functions, read
How the connection pool works
, in the
Prisma documentation
.
The default size of the Prisma connection pool is determined by the following formula:
num_physical_cpus * 2 + 1
, where
num_physical_cpus
represents the number of physical CPUs on the machine where your application runs. For example, if your machine has four physical CPUs, your connection pool will contain nine connections (4 * 2 + 1 = 9). As mentioned in the
Prisma documentation
, this formula is a good starting point, but the recommended connection limit also depends on your deployment paradigm — particularly if you are using serverless. You can specify the number of connections explicitly by setting the
connection_limit
parameter in your database connection URL. For example:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=15&connection_limit=20"
For configuration guidance, refer to Prisma's
Recommended connection pool size guide
.
In addition to pool size, you can configure a
pool_timeout
setting. This setting defines the amount of time the Prisma Client query engine has to process a query before it throws an exception and moves on to the next query in the queue. The default
pool_timeout
setting is 10 seconds. If you still experience timeouts after increasing
connection_limit
setting, you can try setting the
pool_timeout
parameter to a value larger than the default (10 seconds). For configuration guidance, refer to
Increasing the pool timeout
, in the
Prisma documentation
.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=15&connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=15"
You can disable pool timeouts by setting
pool_timeout=0
.
JSON protocol for large Prisma schemas
If you are working with a large Prisma schema, Prisma recently introduced a
jsonProtocol
wire protocol feature that expresses queries using
JSON
instead of GraphQL. The JSON implementation uses less CPU and memory, which can help reduce latencies when connecting from Prisma.
jsonProtocol
is the default wire protocol as of Prisma version 5.0.0. If you run Prisma version 5.0.0 or later, you are already using the new protocol. If you run Prisma version 4 or earlier, you must use a feature flag to enable the
jsonProtocol
. You can read more about this feature here:
jsonProtocol changes
.

Project collaboration
Learn how to invite people to collaborate on your Neon project
You can invite other users to collaborate with you on a Neon project. Project collaboration lets other users access and contribute to your project from all supported Neon interfaces, including the Neon Console, Neon API, and Neon CLI. Follow this guide to learn how.
note
Use project collaboration to work with people outside your organization. If you're working with team members, create an
Organization
instead. Organization members get automatic access to all projects within that organization. Organizations can still use project collaboration when needed — for example, to allow an external contractor to contribute to a specific project without making them a full organization member.
Set up Neon accounts
You can invite anyone outside your organization to collaborate on your Neon project. To collaborate on a project, the user must have a Neon account, which can be a Neon Free Plan or a paid plan account.
If the user does not have a Neon account, ask them to sign up. You can provide your users with the following instructions:
Sign up
.
Request the email address the user signed up with. If the user signed up using Google or GitHub, request the email address associated with that account.
Invite collaborators
After a user has provided you with the email address associated with their Neon account, you can invite them to your project.
To invite a collaborator to your project:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select the project you want to invite collaborators to.
In the Neon
Settings
, choose
Collaborators
from the sidebar.
Click
Invite
. In the modal that pops up, enter the email address of the person you'd like to invite. You can enter multiple emails separated by commas.
Click
Invite
in the modal to confirm; the specified email(s) will be added to the list of
Collaborators
.
Review the list of collaborators to verify the user was successfully added.
The invited users will be granted access to the project, but they will not have privileges to delete the project. They can also invite other users to join the collaboration. When they log into Neon, the project will appear under the
Projects
section, listed as
Shared with me
.
An email is sent to the invited users informing them of the project invitation, including an
Open project
link for easy access.
Invites not received?
If invite emails aren’t received, they may be in spam or quarantined. Recipients should check these folders and mark Neon emails as safe.
Project collaboration limits
When you invite a user to your project, they operate under
your
project allowances so long as they're using your project. For example, a Neon Free Plan user is limited to 10 branches per project, but if they are using your project, there is no such restriction. For teams working together frequently across multiple projects,
organization
membership offers a better collaboration experience.
Access for collaborators via the Neon API or CLI
Collaborators you invite to a project can access it from all supported Neon interfaces, including the Neon Console,
Neon API
, and
Neon CLI
.
Collaborators can use their own API key to access the project via the Neon API. See
Manage API keys
for details on generating an API key.
When using the Neon CLI, collaborators authenticate as they normally would. They can access both their own Neon projects and any projects they are collaborating on. See
Neon CLI — Connect
for authentication instructions.
Billing for projects with collaborators
All costs associated with a project are charged to the Neon account that owns it. For example, if you invite someone to collaborate on your project, any usage incurred by that collaborator will be billed to your Neon account.

Protected branches
Learn how to use Neon's protected branches feature to secure your critical data
Neon's protected branches feature implements a series of protections:
Protected branches cannot be deleted.
Protected branches cannot be
reset
.
Projects with protected branches cannot be deleted.
Computes associated with a protected branch cannot be deleted.
New passwords are automatically generated for Postgres roles on branches created from protected branches.
See below
.
With additional configuration steps, you can apply IP Allow restrictions to protected branches only. The
IP Allow
feature is available on the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plans. See
below
.
Protected branches are not
archived
due to inactivity.
The protected branches feature is available on all Neon paid plans.
Set a branch as protected
This example sets a single branch as protected, but you can have up to 2 protected branches on the Launch plan and 5 on the Scale plan.
To set a branch as protected:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
to view the branches for the project.
Select a branch from the table. In this example, we'll configure our default branch
main
as a protected branch.
On the branch page, click the
Actions
drop-down menu and select
Set as protected
.
In the
Set as protected
confirmation dialog, click
Set as protected
to confirm your selection.
Your branch is now designated as protected, as indicated by the protected branch shield icon, shown below.
The protected branch designation also appears on your
Branches
page.
New passwords generated for Postgres roles on child branches
When you create a branch in Neon, it includes all Postgres databases and roles from the parent branch. By default, Postgres roles on the child branch will have the same passwords as on the parent branch. However, this does not apply to protected branches. When you create a child branch from a protected branch, new passwords are generated for the matching Postgres roles on the child branch.
This behavior is designed to prevent the exposure of passwords that could be used to access your protected branch. For example, if you have designated a production branch as protected, the automatic password change for child branches ensures that you can create child branches for development or testing without risking access to data on your production branch.
Please note that resetting or restoring a child branch from a protected parent branch preserves passwords for matching Postgres roles on the child branch. Please refer to the feature notes below for more.
Feature notes
The "new password" feature for child branches was released on July, 31, 2024. If you have existing CI scripts that create branches from protected branches, please be aware that passwords for matching Postgres roles on those newly created branches will now differ. If you depend on those passwords being the same, you'll need to make adjustments to get the correct connection details for those branches.
After a branch is created, the up-to-date connection string is returned in the output of the
Create Branch GitHub Action
.
The
Reset Branch GitHub Action
also outputs connection string values, in case you are using this action in your workflows.
The Neon CLI supports a
connection-string
command for retrieving a branch's connection string.
Prior to September, 6, 2024, resetting or restoring a child branch from a protected parent branch restored passwords for matching Postgres roles on the child branch to those used on the protected parent branch. As of September, 6, 2024, passwords for matching Postgres roles on the child branch are preserved when resetting or restoring a child branch from a protected parent branch.
How to apply IP restrictions to protected branches
On Neon's
Business
plan, you can use the protected branches feature in combination with Neon's
IP Allow
feature to apply IP access restrictions to protected branches only. The basic setup steps are:
Define an IP allowlist for your project
Restrict IP access to protected branches only
Set a branch as protected
(if you have not done so already)
Define an IP allowlist for your project
Neon Console
CLI
API
To configure an allowlist:
Select a project in the Neon Console.
On the Project Dashboard, select
Settings
.
Select
Network Security
.
Under
IP Allow
, specify the IP addresses you want to permit. Separate multiple entries with commas.
Click
Save changes
.
For details about specifying IP addresses, see
How to specify IP addresses
.
Restrict IP access to protected branches only
After defining an IP allowlist, the next step is to select the
Restrict access to protected branches only
option.
This option removes IP restrictions from
all branches
in your Neon project and applies them to protected branches only.
After you've selected the protected branches option, click
Save changes
to apply the new configuration.
Remove branch protection
Removing a protected branch designation can be performed by selecting
Set as unprotected
from the
Actions
menu on the branch page.

Connect a Python application to Neon using Psycopg
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Python application using Psycopg
This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from a simple Python application using
Psycopg (psycopg2)
, a popular Postgres database adapter for the Python programming language. The application connects to Neon and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.
To connect a Python application to Neon:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
The project is created with a ready-to-use
neondb
database, which you will connect to.
Create a Python project
Create a project directory and change to the newly created directory.
mkdir
neon-python-example
cd
neon-python-example
Set up a Python virtual environment in this directory. The virtual environment isolates your project's Python environment (including installed packages) from the rest of your system.
python3
-m
venv
env
Activate the virtual environment. When the virtual environment is activated, Python uses the environment's version of Python and any installed packages.
source
env/bin/activate
Install the following dependencies in your project's root directory for synchronous and asynchronous code, respectively. You can install them using
pip
:
synchronous
asynchronous
pip
install
psycopg2-binary
python-dotenv
Store your Neon credentials
Add a
.env
file to your project's root directory and add your Neon connection string to it.
You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Your connection string will look something like this:
DATABASE_URL
=
postgresql://[user
]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
?
sslmode
=
require
Configure your python script
Add a
neon-connect.py
file to your project's root directory and add the following code. The script connects to your Neon database and retrieves the current time and Postgres version.

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Ruby on Rails
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Rails project
Ruby on Rails
is a popular web application framework for Ruby developers. It provides an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer called
Active Record
, that simplifies database interactions and schema management. Rails also includes a powerful migration system that allows you to define and manage database schema changes over time.
This guide demonstrates how to run schema migrations in your Ruby on Rails project backed by the
Neon
Postgres database. We'll create a simple Rails application and walk through the process of setting up the database, defining models, and generating and running migrations to manage schema changes.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
Ruby
installed on your local machine.
You can install Ruby using the instructions provided on the
official Ruby website
. We recommend using a newer version of Ruby, 3.0 or higher.
Rails
installed on your local machine. You can install Rails by running
gem install rails
.
We recommend using Rails 6 or higher. This project uses
Rails 7.1.3.2
.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select a project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings. You can find a connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can be prone to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Setting up the Rails project
Create a new Rails project
Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Rails project:
rails
new
guide-neon-rails
--database=postgresql
This command creates a new Rails project named
guide-neon-rails
with Postgres as the default database. It will also generate the necessary project files and directories, and install the required dependencies.
Set up the Database configuration
Create a
.env
file in the project root directory and add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to it. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon Console earlier:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
For Rails to load the environment variables automatically from the
.env
file, add the
dotenv-rails
gem to the
Gemfile
at the root of your project:
# Gemfile
gem
'dotenv-rails'
,
groups: [:development
,
:test]
Then, run
bundle install
to install the gem.
Finally, we open the
config/database.yml
file in your project directory and update the
default
section so that Rails uses the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to connect to the
Neon
database.
# database.yml
default
:
&
default
adapter
:
postgresql
encoding
:
unicode
pool
:
<%= ENV.fetch("RAILS_MAX_THREADS") { 5 } %>
url
:
<%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
development
:
<<
:
*
default
test
:
<<
:
*
default
production
:
<<
:
*
default
Defining data models and running migrations
Generate models and migrations
Next, we will create the data models for our application. Run the following commands to generate the
Author
and
Book
models:
rails
generate
model
Author
name:string
bio:text
rails
generate
model
Book
title:string
author:references
These commands generate model files and the corresponding migration files in the
app/models
and
db/migrate
directories, respectively.
Run the migrations
To run the migrations and create the corresponding tables in the Neon Postgres database, run the following command:
rails
db:migrate
This command executes the migration files and creates the
authors
and
books
tables in the database. Additionally, it also creates some tables for its internal bookkeeping.
Seed the database
To populate the database with some initial data, open the
db/seeds.rb
file and add the following code:
# db/seeds.rb
# Find or create authors
authors_data
=
[
{
name:
"J.R.R. Tolkien"
,
bio:
"The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings."
}
,
{
name:
"George R.R. Martin"
,
bio:
"The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire."
}
,
{
name:
"J.K. Rowling"
,
bio:
"The creator of the Harry Potter series."
}
]
authors_data
.
each
do
|
author_attrs
|
Author
.
find_or_create_by(name: author_attrs[:name])
do
|
author
|
author
.
bio
=
author_attrs[:bio]
end
end
# Find or create books
books_data
=
[
{ title:
"The Fellowship of the Ring"
,
author_name:
"J.R.R. Tolkien"
}
,
{ title:
"The Two Towers"
,
author_name:
"J.R.R. Tolkien"
}
,
{ title:
"The Return of the King"
,
author_name:
"J.R.R. Tolkien"
}
,
{ title:
"A Game of Thrones"
,
author_name:
"George R.R. Martin"
}
,
{ title:
"A Clash of Kings"
,
author_name:
"George R.R. Martin"
}
,
{ title:
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"
,
author_name:
"J.K. Rowling"
}
,
{ title:
"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
,
author_name:
"J.K. Rowling"
}
]
books_data
.
each
do
|
book_attrs
|
author
=
Author
.
find_by(name: book_attrs[:author_name])
Book
.
find_or_create_by(title: book_attrs[:title]
,
author: author)
end
To run the seed file and populate the database with the initial data, run the following command:
rails
db:seed
This command inserts the sample authors and books data into the database. Note that the script looks for existing records before creating new ones, so you can run it multiple times without duplicating the data.
Implement the application
Create controllers and views
Next, we will create controllers and views to display the authors and books in our application. Run the following commands to generate the controllers:
rails
generate
controller
Authors
index
rails
generate
controller
Books
index
These commands generate controller files and corresponding view files in the
app/controllers
and
app/views
directories.
Open the
app/controllers/authors_controller.rb
file and update the
index
action:
# app/controllers/authors_controller.rb
class
AuthorsController
<
ApplicationController
def
index
@authors
=
Author
.
all
end
end
Similarly, open the
app/controllers/books_controller.rb
file and update the
index
action:
# app/controllers/books_controller.rb
class
BooksController
<
ApplicationController
def
index
@author
=
Author
.
find(params[:author_id])
@books
=
@author
.
books
end
end
Now, we update the corresponding views to display the data. Open the
app/views/authors/index.html.erb
file and add the following code:
<!-- app/views/authors/index.html.erb -->
<
h1
>Authors</
h1
>
<
ul
>
<% @authors
.
each
do
|
author
|
%>
<
li
>
<%= author
.
name %> - <%= link_to
'Books'
,
author_books_path(author_id: author
.
id) %>
</
li
>
<%
end
%>
</
ul
>
Open the
app/views/books/index.html.erb
file and add the following code:
<!-- app/views/books/index.html.erb -->
<
h1
>Books by <%= @author
.
name %></
h1
>
<
ul
>
<% @books
.
each
do
|
book
|
%>
<
li
><%= book
.
title %></
li
>
<%
end
%>
</
ul
>
Define routes
Open the
config/routes.rb
file and define the routes for the authors and books:
# config/routes.rb
Rails
.
application
.
routes
.
draw
do
resources :authors
,
only: [:index]
get
'/books/:author_id'
,
to:
'books#index'
,
as:
'author_books'
end
Run the Rails server
To start the Rails server and test the application, run the following command:
rails
server
Navigate to the url
http://localhost:3000/authors
in your browser to view the list of authors. You can also view the books by a specific author by clicking on the "Books" link next to each author, which takes you to the
http://localhost:3000/books/:author_id
route.
Applying schema changes
We will demonstrate how to handle schema changes by adding a new field
country
to the
Author
model, to store the author's country of origin.
Generate a migration
To generate a migration file for adding the
country
field to the
authors
table, run the following command:
rails
generate
migration
AddCountryToAuthors
country:string
This command generates a new migration file in the
db/migrate
directory.
Run the migration
To run the migration and apply the schema change, run the following command:
rails
db:migrate
This command executes the migration file and adds the
country
column to the
authors
table in the database.
Update the existing records
To update the existing records with the author's country, open the
db/seeds.rb
file and update the authors data with the country information:
authors_data
=
[
{
name:
"J.R.R. Tolkien"
,
bio:
"The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings."
,
country:
"United Kingdom"
}
,
{
name:
"George R.R. Martin"
,
bio:
"The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire."
,
country:
"United States"
}
,
{
name:
"J.K. Rowling"
,
bio:
"The creator of the Harry Potter series."
,
country:
"United Kingdom"
}
]
authors_data
.
each
do
|
author_attrs
|
author
=
Author
.
find_or_initialize_by(name: author_attrs[:name])
author
.
assign_attributes(author_attrs)
author
.
save
if
author
.
changed?
end
Run the seed file again to update the existing records in the database:
rails
db:seed
Test the schema change
Update the
app/views/authors/index.html.erb
file to display the country alongside each author:
<!-- app/views/authors/index.html.erb -->
<
h1
>Authors</
h1
>
<
ul
>
<% @authors
.
each
do
|
author
|
%>
<
li
>
<%= author
.
name %> - <%= author
.
country %> - <%= link_to
'Books'
,
author_books_path(author_id: author
.
id) %>
</
li
>
<%
end
%>
</
ul
>
Now, restart the Rails server:
rails
server
Navigate to the url
http://localhost:3000/authors
to view the list of authors. The
country
field is now available for each author, reflecting the schema change.
Conclusion

Use Neon Postgres with Railway
Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Node application deployed with Railway
Railway
is an application deployment platform that allows users to develop web applications locally, provision infrastructure and then deploy to the cloud. Railway integrates with GitHub for continuous deployment and supports a variety of programming languages and frameworks.
This guide shows how to deploy a simple Node.js application connected to a Neon Postgres database on Railway.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A Railway account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Railway
to get started.
A GitHub account. Railway integrates with Gitub for continuous deployment. So, you'd need a GitHub account to upload your application code.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Click the
New Project
button to create a new project.
From your project dashboard, navigate to the
SQL Editor
from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:
CREATE
TABLE
plant_care_log
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
plant_name
VARCHAR
(
255
)
NOT NULL
,
care_date
DATE
NOT NULL
);
Next, we insert some sample data into the
plant_care_log
table, so we can query it later:
INSERT INTO
plant_care_log (plant_name, care_date)
VALUES
(
'Monstera'
,
'2024-01-10'
),
(
'Fiddle Leaf Fig'
,
'2024-01-15'
),
(
'Snake Plant'
,
'2024-01-20'
),
(
'Spider Plant'
,
'2024-01-25'
),
(
'Pothos'
,
'2024-01-30'
);
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Implementing the Node.js application
We'll create a simple Express application that connects to our Neon database and retrieves the list of plants tended to within the last month. Run the following commands in a terminal to set it up.
mkdir
neon-railway-example
&&
cd
neon-railway-example
npm
init
-y
&&
npm
pkg
set
type=
"module"
npm
install
express
pg
touch
.env
We use the
npm pkg set type="module"
command to enable ES6 module support in our project. We also create a new
.env
file to store the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable, which we'll use to connect to our Neon database. Lastly, we install the
pg
library which is the Postgres driver we use to connect to our database.
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
Now, create a new file named
index.js
and add the following code:
import
express
from
'express'
;
import
pkg
from
'pg'
;
const
app
=
express
();
const
port
=
process
.
env
.
PORT
||
3000
;
// Parse JSON bodies for this app
app
.use
(
express
.json
());
// Create a new pool using your Neon database connection string
const
{
Pool
}
=
pkg;
const
pool
=
new
Pool
({ connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
});
app
.get
(
'/'
,
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
try
{
// Fetch the list of plants from your database using the postgres connection
const
{
rows
}
=
await
pool
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM plant_care_log;'
);
res
.json
(rows);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Failed to fetch plants'
,
error);
res
.status
(
500
)
.json
({ error
:
'Internal Server Error'
});
}
});
// Start the server
app
.listen
(port
,
()
=>
{
console
.log
(
`Server running on http://localhost:
${
port
}
`
);
});
This code sets up an Express server that listens for requests on port 3000. When a request is made to the
URL
, the server queries the
plant_care_log
table in your Neon database and returns the results as JSON.
We can test this application locally by running:
node
--env-file=.env
index.js
Now, navigate to
http://localhost:3000/
in your browser to check it returns the sample data from the
plant_care_log
table.
Push Your application to GitHub
To deploy your application to Railway, you need to push your code to a GitHub repository. Create a new repository on GitHub by navigating to
GitHub - New Repo
. You can then push your code to the new repository using the following commands:
echo
"node_modules/"
>
.gitignore
&&
echo
".env"
>>
.gitignore
echo
"# neon-railway-example"
>>
README.md
git
init
&&
git
add
.
&&
git
commit
-m
"Initial commit"
git
branch
-M
main
git
remote
add
origin
YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git
push
-u
origin
main
You can visit the GitHub repository to verify that your code has been pushed successfully.
Deploying to Railway
Creating a new Railway project
Log in to your Railway account and navigate to the dashboard. Click on the
New Project
button and select the
Deploy from GitHub repo
option. Pick the repository you created above, which sets off a Railway deployment.
Railway automatically figures out the type of application you're deploying and sets up the necessary build and start commands. However, we still need to add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to connect to our Neon database.
Select the project and navigate to the
Variables
tab. Add a new variable named
DATABASE_URL
and set its value to your Neon database connection string. You can redeploy the project by clicking on
Redeploy
from the context menu of the latest deployment.
Verify Deployment
Once the deployment completes and is marked as
ACTIVE
, Railway provides a public URL for accessing the web service. Visit the provided URL to verify that your application is running and can connect to your Neon database.
Whenever you update your code and push it to your GitHub repository, Railway will automatically build and deploy the changes to your web service.
Removing Your Application and Neon Project
To remove your application from Railway, select the project and navigate to the
Settings
tab. Scroll down to the end to find the "Delete Service" option.
To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under
Delete a project

Build a Python App with Reflex and Neon
Learn how to build a Python Full Stack application with Reflex and Neon
Reflex
is a Python web framework that allows you to build full-stack applications with Python.
Using Reflex, you can build frontend and backend applications using Python to manage the interaction between the frontend UI and the state with the server-side logic. To make the application data-driven, you can connect to a Neon Postgres database.
To connect to Neon from a Reflex application:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
To create a Neon project:
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Set up a Reflex project
To set up a Reflex project, you need to install the Reflex CLI and create a new project.
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies. In this example,
venv
is used to create a virtual environment. You can use any other virtual environment manager of your choice like
poetry
,
pipenv
, or
uv
.
To create a virtual environment, run the following command in your project directory:
MacOS
Windows
python3
-m
venv
.venv
source
.venv/bin/activate
Install the Reflex CLI
To install the Reflex CLI, run the following command:
pip
install
reflex
Create a new Reflex project
First, create a project directory for the Reflex app.
mkdir
new_project
cd
new_project
To initialize the Reflex app, run the following command:
reflex
init
When a project is initialized, the Reflex CLI creates a project directory. This directory will contain the following files and directories:
<
new_project
>
├──
.web
├──
assets
├──
<
new_projec
t
>
│
├──
__init__.py
│
└──
<
new_projec
t
>
.py
└──
rxconfig.py
The
rxconfig.py
file contains the project configuration settings. This is where the database connection settings will be defined.
Run the Reflex App
To run the Reflex app, use the following command:
reflex
run
The Reflex server starts and runs on
http://localhost:3000
.
Configure Reflex connection settings
Now that you have set up a Reflex project, you can configure the connection settings to connect to Neon.
To configure the connection settings:
Open the
rxconfig.py
file in the project directory.
Adjust the following code in the
rxconfig.py
file to match your Neon connection details:
# rxconfig.py
import
reflex
as
rx
config
=
rx
.
Config
(
app_name
=
"new_project"
,
# Connect to your own database.
db_url
=
"<connection-string-from-neon>"
,
)
Replace
<connection-string-from-neon>
with your Neon connection string. You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
note
Replace the value for
db_url
with an environment variable or the connection string from Neon. For example, after creating an environment variable named
NEON_DATABASE_URL
, you can use it as follows:
import
os
DATABASE_URL
=
os
.
getenv
(
"NEON_DATABASE_URL"
)
config
=
rx
.
Config
(
app_name
=
"new_project"
,
db_url
=
DATABASE_URL,
)
Save the changes to the
rxconfig.py
file.
Now, you can run the Reflex app and start building your Python full-stack application with Reflex and Neon.
Creating a data model
To create a data model in Reflex, you can define a Python class that represents the data structure. Reflex uses
sqlmodel
to provide a built-in ORM wrapping
SQLAlchemy
.
For example, you can create a
Customer
model as follows:
# <new_project>/models.py
import
reflex
as
rx
class
Customer
(
rx
.
Model
,
table
=
True
):
"""The customer model."""
name
:
str
email
:
str
phone
:
str
address
:
str
This code defines a
Customer
model with fields for
name
,
email
,
phone
, and
address
. The
table=True
argument tells Reflex to create a table in the database for this class.
You can then use this model to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the
Customer
data.
Creating the table with the model:
reflex
db
init
This command creates the table in the database based on the model definition using an alembic migration.
Now you can use the
Customer
model to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the
Customer
data.
For example, you can add a new customer to the database as follows:
with
rx
.
session
()
as
session
:
session
.
add
(
Customer
(
name
=
"Alice"
,
email
=
"user@test.com"
,
phone
=
"1234567890"
,
address
=
"123 Main St"
,
)
)
session
.
commit
()
This code creates a new
Customer
object and adds it to the database using a session. The
session.commit()
method saves the changes to the database. If you change the table schema, you can run the following command to update the database:
reflex
db
makemigrations
--message
'<describe what changed>'
This command generates a new migration file that describes the changes to the database schema. You can then apply the migration to the database with the following command:
reflex
db
migrate
This command applies the migration to the database, updating the schema to match the model definition.

Use Neon Postgres with Render
Connect a Neon Postgres database to your Node application deployed with Render
Render
is a comprehensive cloud service that provides hosting for web applications and static sites, with PR previews, zero-downtime deployments, and more. Render supports full-stack applications, offering both web services and background workers.
This guide shows how to deploy a simple Node.js application connected to a Neon Postgres database on Render.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
A Render account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Render
to get started.
A GitHub account. Render integrates with public GitHub providers for continuous deployment. So, you'd need a GitHub account to upload your application code.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Click the
New Project
button to create a new project.
From your project dashboard, navigate to the
SQL Editor
from the sidebar, and run the following SQL command to create a new table in your database:
CREATE
TABLE
books_to_read
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
title
TEXT
,
author
TEXT
);
Next, we insert some sample data into the
books_to_read
table, so we can query it later:
INSERT INTO
books_to_read (title, author)
VALUES
(
'The Way of Kings'
,
'Brandon Sanderson'
),
(
'The Name of the Wind'
,
'Patrick Rothfuss'
),
(
'Coders at Work'
,
'Peter Seibel'
),
(
'1984'
,
'George Orwell'
);
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
Implementing the Node.js application
We'll create a simple Express application that connects to our Neon database and retrieve the sample data from the
books_to_read
table. Run the following commands in a terminal to set it up.
mkdir
neon-render-example
&&
cd
neon-render-example
npm
init
-y
&&
npm
pkg
set
type=
"module"
npm
install
express
pg
touch
.env
We use the
npm pkg set type="module"
command to enable ES6 module support in our project. We also create a new
.env
file to store the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable, which we'll use to connect to our Neon database. Lastly, we install the
pg
library which is the Postgres driver we use to connect to our database.
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
Now, create a new file named
index.js
and add the following code:
import
express
from
'express'
;
import
pkg
from
'pg'
;
const
app
=
express
();
const
port
=
process
.
env
.
PORT
||
3000
;
// Parse JSON bodies for this app
app
.use
(
express
.json
());
// Create a new pool using your Neon database connection string
const
{
Pool
}
=
pkg;
const
pool
=
new
Pool
({ connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
});
app
.get
(
'/'
,
async
(req
,
res)
=>
{
try
{
// Fetch books from your database using the postgres connection
const
{
rows
}
=
await
pool
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM books_to_read;'
);
res
.json
(rows);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Failed to fetch books'
,
error);
res
.status
(
500
)
.json
({ error
:
'Internal Server Error'
});
}
});
// Start the server
app
.listen
(port
,
()
=>
{
console
.log
(
`Server running on http://localhost:
${
port
}
`
);
});
This code sets up an Express server that listens for requests on port 3000. When a request is made to the
URL
, the server queries the
books_to_read
table in your Neon database and returns the results as JSON.
We can test this application locally by running:
node
--env-file=.env
index.js
Now, navigate to
http://localhost:3000/
in your browser to check that it returns the sample data from the
books_to_read
table.
Push Your application to GitHub
To deploy your application to Render, you need to push your code to a GitHub repository. Create a new repository on GitHub by navigating to
GitHub - New Repo
. You can then push your code to the new repository using the following commands:
echo
"node_modules/"
>
.gitignore
&&
echo
".env"
>>
.gitignore
echo
"# neon-render-example"
>>
README.md
git
init
&&
git
add
.
&&
git
commit
-m
"Initial commit"
git
branch
-M
main
git
remote
add
origin
YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git
push
-u
origin
main
You can visit the GitHub repository to verify that your code has been pushed successfully.
Deploying to Render
Create a New Web Service on Render
Log in to your Render account and navigate to the dashboard. Click on the
New +
button and select "Web Service". Pick the option to
build and deploy
from a Git repository.
Next, choose the GitHub repository hosting the Node.js application we created above. Configure your web service as follows: -
Environment
: Select "Node". -
Build Command
: Enter
npm install
. -
Start Command
: Enter
node index.js
. -
Environment Variables
: Add your Neon database connection string from earlier as an environment variable: - Name:
DATABASE_URL
- Value:
{NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING}
Click "Create Web Service" to finish. Render will automatically deploy your application and redirect you to the service dashboard, showing the deployment progress and the logs.
Verify Deployment
Once the deployment completes, Render provides a public URL for accessing the web service. Visit the provided URL to verify that your application is running and can connect to your Neon database.
Whenever you update your code and push it to your GitHub repository, Render will automatically build and deploy the changes to your web service.
Removing Your Application and Neon Project
To remove your application from Render, navigate to the dashboard, select
Settings
for the deployed application, and scroll down to find the "Delete Web Service" option.
To delete your Neon project, follow the steps outlined in the Neon documentation under
Delete a project

Reset from parent
Learn how to reset a branch from its parent
Neon's
Reset from parent
feature lets you instantly reset all databases on a branch to the latest schema and data from its parent branch, helping you recover from issues, start on new feature development, or keep the different branches in your environment in sync.
Example scenario
When working with database branches, you might find yourself in a situation where you need to update your working branch to the latest data from your production branch.
For example, let's say you have two child branches
staging
and
development
forked from your
production
branch. You have been working on the
development
branch and find it is now too far out of date with
production
.
You have no schema changes in
development
to consider or preserve; you just want a quick refresh of the data. With the
Reset from parent
feature, you can perform a clean, instant reset to the latest data from the parent in a single operation, saving you the complication of manually creating and restoring branches.
How Reset from parent works
When you reset a branch to its parent, the data and schema is completely replaced with the latest data and schema from its parent.
Key points
You can only reset a branch to the latest data from its parent. Point-in-time resets based on timestamp or LSN are possible using
Instant restore
, a similar feature, with some differences: instant restore leaves a backup branch and is in general is intended more for data recovery than development workflow.
This reset is a complete overwrite, not a refresh or a merge. Any local changes made to the child branch are lost during this reset.
Existing connections will be temporarily interrupted during the reset. However, your connection details
do not change
. All connections are re-established as soon as the reset is done.
Root branches (like your project's
production
branch or schema-only branches) cannot be reset because they have no parent branch to reset to.
How to Reset from parent
You can reset any branch to its parent using any of our tools.
Console
CLI
API
On the
Branches
page in the Neon Console, select the branch that you want to reset.
The console opens to the details page for your branch, giving you key information about the branch and its child status: its parent, the last time it was reset, and other relevent detail.
To reset the branch, select
Reset from parent
from the
Actions
menu or the
Last data reset
panel.
note
If this branch has children of its own, resetting is blocked. The resulting error dialog lets you delete these child branches, after which you can continue with the reset.
Integrating branch resets in CI/CD workflows
You can include resetting database branches as part of your CI/CD workflow. For example, when
starting a new feature
or
refreshing staging
.
For new features
Start feature development with a clean slate by resetting your development branch to align with staging or production (whichever is its parent). This replaces the branch's current state with the parent's latest data and schema. Use the command:
neon
branches
reset
dev-branch
--parent
This strategy preserves a stable connection string for your development environment, while still ensuring every new feature begins with a fully updated and consistent environment.
Refresh staging
Reset
staging
to match its parent branch (i.e.,
production
) for a reliable testing baseline. Automate staging updates with:
neon
branches
reset
staging
--parent
This ensures staging accurately reflects the current production state for reliable testing.

Connect a Ruby on Rails application to Neon Postgres
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from a Ruby on Rails application
Ruby on Rails
, also known simply as Rails, is an open-source web application framework written in Ruby. It uses a model-view-controller architecture, making it a good choice for developing database-backed web applications. This guide shows how to connect to a Ruby on Rails application to a Neon Postgres database.
To connect to Neon from a Ruby on Rails application:
note
This guide was tested using Ruby v3.3.0 and Rails v7.1.2.
Create a Neon Project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a Rails Project
Create a Rails project using the
Rails CLI
, and specify PostgreSQL as the database type:
gem
install
rails
rails
new
neon-with-rails
--database=postgresql
You now have a Rails project in a folder named
neon-with-rails
.
Configure a PostgreSQL Database using Rails
Create a
.env
file in the root of your Rails project, and add the connection string for your Neon compute. Do not specify a database name after the forward slash in the connection string. Rails will choose the correct database depending on the environment.
DATABASE_URL
=
postgresql://[user
]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/
note
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
important
The role you specified in the
DATABASE_URL
must have
CREATEDB
privileges. Roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role, which has the
CREATEDB
privilege. Alternatively, you can create roles with SQL to grant specific privileges. See
Manage database access
.
Create the development database by issuing the following commands from the root of your project directory:
# Load the DATABASE_URL into your session
source
.env
# Create the development database
bin/rails
db:create
Create a Rails Controller to Query the Database
Run the following command to create a controller and view. The controller will query the database version and supply it to the view file to render a web page that displays the PostgreSQL version.
rails
g
controller
home
index
Replace the controller contents at
app/controllers/home_controller.rb
with:
class
HomeController
<
ApplicationController
def
index
@version
=
ActiveRecord
::
Base
.
connection
.
execute(
"SELECT version();"
)
.
first[
'version'
]
end
end
Replace the contents of the view file at
app/views/home/index.html.erb
with:
<%
if
@version
%>
<p>
<%=
@version
%></p>
<%
end
%>
Replace the contents of
config/routes.rb
with the following code to serve your home view as the root page of the application:
Rails
.
application
.
routes
.
draw
do
.
get
"up"
=>
"rails/health#show"
,
as: :rails_health_check
# Defines the root path route ("/")
root
'home#index'
end
Run the application
Start the application using the Rails CLI from the root of the project:
bin/rails
server
-e
development
Visit
localhost:3000/
in your web browser. Your Neon database's Postgres version will be displayed. For example:
PostgreSQL

Configuring Scale to Zero for Neon computes
Learn how to configure Neon's Scale to Zero feature
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature controls whether a Neon compute transitions to an idle state due to inactivity. For example, if scale to zero is enabled, your compute will transition to an idle state after it's been inactive for 5 minutes. Neon's paid plans allow you to disable scale to zero to keep your compute active.
important
If you disable scale to zero entirely, your compute will remain active, and you will have to manually restart your compute to pick up the latest updates to Neon's compute images. Neon typically releases compute-related updates weekly. Not all releases contain critical updates, but a weekly compute restart is recommended to ensure that you do not miss anything important. For how to restart a compute, see
Restart a compute
.
This guide demonstrates how to configure the scale to zero setting for a new project, for an existing project, or for an individual compute.
Scale to zero limits

Configure scale to zero for a compute
To configure the scale to zero setting for an individual compute:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
On the
Computes
tab, click
Edit
.
Specify your scale to zero setting.
Click
Save
.
Configure the scale to zero default
Configuring the scale to zero setting in your project's settings sets the project's default, which is applied to all computes created from that point forward. Existing compute scale to zero settings are unaffected. See
Change your project's default compute settings
for more info about compute defaults.
To configure the scale to zero default for an existing project:
Select a project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Compute
and click
Change
.
Specify your scale to zero setting.
Click
Save
.
Monitor scale to zero
You can monitor scale to zero on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console. A compute reports either an
Active
or
Idle
status.
You can also view compute state transitions in the
Branches
widget on the Neon
Dashboard
.
User actions that activate an idle compute include
connecting from a client such as psql
, running a query on your database from the
Neon SQL Editor
, or accessing the compute via the
Neon API
.
info
The Neon API includes a
Start endpoint
method for the specific purpose of activating and suspending a compute.
You can try any of these methods and watch the status of your compute as it transitions from an
Idle
to an
Active
state.
Session context considerations
When a compute suspends and later restarts, the
session context
resets. This includes in-memory statistics, temporary tables, prepared statements, and autovacuum thresholds, among other session-specific data. If your workflow requires persistent session data, consider disabling scale to zero on a paid plan to keep your compute active continuously. On the Free plan, scale to zero is always enabled and automatically suspends your compute after 5 minutes of inactivity.

Schema diff
Learn how to use Neon's Schema Diff tool to compare branches of your database
Neon's Schema Diff tool lets you compare an SQL script of the schemas for two selected branches in a side-by-side view (or line-by-line on mobile devices).
How Schema Diff works
Schema Diff is available in the Neon Console for use in two ways:
Compare a branch's schema to its parent
Compare selected branches during an instant restore operation
You can also use the
branches schema-diff
command in the Neon CLI or
compare-schema
endpoint in the Neon API to effect a variety of comparisons.
Compare to parent
In the detailed view for any child branch, you can check the schema differences between the selected branch and its parent. Use this view to verify the state of these schemas before you
Reset from parent
.
Compare to another branch's history
Built into the Time Travel assist editor, you can use Schema Diff to help when restoring branches, letting you compare states of your branch against its own or another branch's history before you complete a
branch restore
operation.
Comparisons using the CLI or API
You can use the Neon CLI to compare a branch to any point in its own or any other branch's history. The
branches schema-diff
command offers full flexibility for any type of schema comparison: between a branch and its parent, a branch and its earlier state, or a branch to the head or prior state of another branch. The Neon API provides a
compare-schema
endpoint that lets you compare schemas between Neon branches programmatically, supporting CI/CD automation and AI agent use cases.
Practical Applications
Pre-Migration Reviews
: Before migrating schemas from a development branch into main, use Schema Diff to ensure only intended schema changes are applied.
Audit Changes
: Historically compare schema changes to understand the evolution of your database structure.
Consistency Checks
: Ensure environment consistency by comparing schemas across development, staging, and production branches.
Automation
: Integrate schema-diff into CI/CD pipelines to automatically compare schemas during deployments.
AI Agents
: Enable AI agents to retrieve schema differences programmatically to support agent-driven database migrations.
How to Use Schema Diff
You can launch the Schema Diff viewer from the
Branches
and
Restore
pages in the Neon Console.
From the Branches page
Open the detailed view for the branch whose schema you want to inspect. In the row of details for the parent branch, under the
COMPARE TO PARENT
block, click
Open schema diff
.
From the Restore page
Just like with
Time Travel Assist
, your first step is to choose the branch you want to restore, then choose where you want to restore from:
From history
(its own history) or ** From another branch** (from another branch's history).
Click the
Schema Diff
button, verify that your selections are correct, then click
Compare
.
The two-pane view shows the schema for both your target and your selected branches.
Using the Neon CLI
You can use the Neon CLI to:
Compare the latest schemas of any two branches
Compare against a specific point in its own or another branch's history
Use the
schema-diff
subcommand from the
branches
command:
neon
branches
schema-diff
[base-branch] [compare-source[
@
(
timestamp
|
lsn
)]]
The operation will compare a selected branch (
[compare-source]
) against the latest (head) of your base branch (
[base-branch]
). For example, if you want to compare recent changes you made to your development branch
development
against your production branch
production
, identify
production
as your base branch and
development
as your compare-source.
neon
branches
schema-diff
production
development
You have a few options here:
Append a timestamp or LSN to compare to a specific point in
development
branch's history.
If you are regularly comparing development branches against
production
, include
production
in your
set-context
file. You can then leave out the [base-branch] from the command.
Use aliases to shorten the command.
Include
--database
to reduce the diff to a single database. If you don't specify a database, the diff will include all databases on the branch.
Here is the same command using aliases, with
production
included in
set-context
, pointing to an LSN from
development
branch's history, and limiting the diff to the database

:

branch

To find out what other comparisons you can make, see
Neon CLI commands — branches
for full documentation of the command.
Using the Neon API
The
compare_schema
endpoint lets you compare schemas between Neon branches to track schema changes. The response highlights differences in a
diff
format, making it a useful tool for integrating schema checks into CI/CD workflows.
Another use case for schema diff via the Neon API is AI agent-driven workflows. The
compare_schema
endpoint allows AI agents to programmatically retrieve schema differences by comparing two branches.
To compare schemas between two branches, you can cURL command similar to the one below, which compares the schema of a target branch to the schema of a base branch. For example, the target branch could be a development branch where a schema change was applied, and the base branch could be the parent of the development branch. By comparing the two, you can inspect the changes that have been made on the development branch.

Schema Diff GitHub Action
Neon supports a
Schema Diff GitHub Action
that performs a database schema diff on specified Neon branches for each pull request and writes a comment to the pull request highlighting the schema differences.
This action supports workflows where schema changes are made on a branch. When you create or update a pull request containing schema changes, the action automatically generates a comment within the pull request. By including the schema diff as part of the comment, reviewers can easily assess the changes directly within the pull request.

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and Sequelize
Set up Neon Postgres and run migrations for your Javascript project using Sequelize ORM
Sequelize
is a promise-based Node.js ORM that supports multiple relational databases. In this guide, we'll explore how to use
Sequelize
ORM with a Neon Postgres database in a JavaScript project.
We'll create a Node.js application, configure
Sequelize
, and show how to set up and run migrations with
Sequelize
.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
Node.js
and
npm
installed on your local machine. We'll use Node.js to build and test the application locally.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select an existing project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings. You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can be prone to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Setting Up the Node application
Create a new Node project
We'll create a simple catalog with API endpoints that query the database for authors and a list of their books. Run the following commands in your terminal to set up a new project using
Express.js
:
mkdir
neon-sequelize-guide
&&
cd
neon-sequelize-guide
npm
init
-y
&&
touch
.env
index.js
npm
install
express
dotenv
Add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to the
.env
file, which you'll use to connect to your Neon database. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon Console earlier:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING
To use the
Sequelize
ORM to run queries, we need to install the
sequelize
package and the
pg
driver to connect to Postgres from Node.js. We also need to install the
sequelize-cli
package to manage data models and run migrations. Run the following commands to install the required packages:
npm
install
sequelize
pg
pg-hstore
npm
install
sequelize-cli
--save-dev
Configure Sequelize
Run the following command to initialize the
sequelize
configuration:
npx
sequelize
init
This command creates
config
,
migrations
,
models
, and
seeders
directories at the project root.
The
config
directory contains the
config.json
file, which holds the database configuration. We want to have the database URL read as an environment variable, so we replace it with a
config.js
file. Create a
config.js
file in your
config/
directory and add the following code:
// config/config.js
const
dotenv
=
require
(
'dotenv'
);
dotenv
.config
();
module
.
exports
=
{
development
:
{
url
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
dialect
:
'postgres'
,
dialectOptions
:
{ ssl
:
{ require
:
true
} }
,
}
,
};
To make the
sequelize
CLI aware of the path to the new configuration file, we need to create a
.sequelizerc
file at the project root and add the following code:
// .sequelizerc
const
path
=
require
(
'path'
);
module
.
exports
=
{
config
:
path
.resolve
(
'config'
,
'config.js'
)
,
};
Create models and set up migrations
We'll create an
Author
and a
Book
model to represent the tables in our database. Run the following commands to create the models:
npx
sequelize
model:generate
--name
Author
--attributes
name:string,bio:string
npx
sequelize
model:generate
--name
Book
--attributes
title:string
Sequelize creates a new file for each model in the
models/
directory and a corresponding migration file in the
migrations/
directory. Sequelize automatically adds an
id
field as the primary key for each model, and
createdAt
and
updatedAt
fields to track the creation and update times of each record.
We still need to define the relationships between the
Author
and
Book
models. Update the
book.js
file with the following code:
// models/book.js
'use strict'
;
const
{
Model
}
=
require
(
'sequelize'
);
module
.
exports
=
(sequelize
,
DataTypes)
=>
{
class
Book
extends
Model
{
static
associate
(models) {
Book
.belongsTo
(
models
.Author
,
{
foreignKey
:
'authorId'
,
as
:
'author'
,
onDelete
:
'CASCADE'
,
});
}
}
Book
.init
(
{
title
:
{ type
:
DataTypes
.
STRING
,
allowNull
:
false
}
,
authorId
:
{ type
:
DataTypes
.
INTEGER
,
allowNull
:
false
}
,
}
,
{
sequelize
,
modelName
:
'Book'
,
}
);
return
Book;
};
Sequelize does not automatically regenerate the migration files when you update the models. So, we need to manually update the migration files to add the foreign key constraint.
Update the migration file corresponding to the
Book
model with the following code:
'use strict'
;
/**
@type
{import('sequelize-cli').Migration}
*/
module
.
exports
=
{
async
up
(queryInterface
,
Sequelize) {
await
queryInterface
.createTable
(
'Books'
,
{
id
:
{
allowNull
:
false
,
autoIncrement
:
true
,
primaryKey
:
true
,
type
:
Sequelize
.
INTEGER
,
}
,
title
:
{
type
:

.

,
}
,
createdAt
:
{
allowNull
:
false
,
type
:
Sequelize
.
DATE
,
}
,
updatedAt
:
{
allowNull
:
false
,
type
:
Sequelize
.
DATE
,
}
,
authorId
:
{
type
:
Sequelize
.
INTEGER
,
onDelete
:
'CASCADE'
,
references
:
{
model
:
'Authors'
,
key
:
'id'
,
}
,
}
,
});
}
,
async
down
(queryInterface
,
Sequelize) {
await
queryInterface
.dropTable
(
'Books'
);
}
,
};
Run the following command to apply the migrations and create the tables in the database:
npx
sequelize
db:migrate
If
Sequlize
successfully connects to the database and runs the migrations, you should see a success message in the terminal.
Add sample data to the database
We'll add some sample data to the database using the
Sequelize
ORM. Create a new file named
seed.js
at the project root and add the following code:
// seed.js
const
{
Sequelize
,
DataTypes
}
=
require
(
'sequelize'
);
const
{
config
}
=
require
(
'dotenv'
);
config
();
if
(
!
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
) {
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL is not set'
);
}
const
sequelize
=
new
Sequelize
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
{
dialectOptions
:
{

}
,
}
,
});
const
Author
=
require
(
'./models/author'
)(sequelize
,
DataTypes);
const
Book
=
require
(
'./models/book'
)(sequelize
,
DataTypes);
const
seedDatabase
=
async
()
=>
{
const
author
=
await
Author
.create
({
name
:
'J.K. Rowling'
,
bio
:
'The creator of the Harry Potter series'
,
});
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"
,
authorId
:
author
.id });
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'
,
authorId
:
author
.id });
const
author2
=
await
Author
.create
({
name
:
'J.R.R. Tolkien'
,
bio
:
'The creator of Middle-earth and author of The Lord of the Rings.'
,
});
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'The Hobbit'
,
authorId
:
author2
.id });
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'The Fellowship of the Ring'
,
authorId
:
author2
.id });
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'The Two Towers'
,
authorId
:
author2
.id });
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'The Return of the King'
,
authorId
:
author2
.id });
const
author3
=
await
Author
.create
({
name
:
'George R.R. Martin'
,
bio
:
'The author of the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.'
,
});
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'A Game of Thrones'
,
authorId
:
author3
.id });
await
Book
.create
({ title
:
'A Clash of Kings'
,
authorId
:
author3
.id });
await
sequelize
.close
();
};
seedDatabase
();
Run the following command to seed the database with the sample data:
node
seed.js
Sequelize will print logs to the terminal as it connects to the database and adds the sample data.
Create API endpoints
Now that the database is set up and populated with data, we can implement the API to query the authors and their books. We'll use
Express
, which is a minimal web application framework for Node.js.
Create an
index.js
file at the project root, and add the following code to set up your Express server:
// index.js
const
express
=
require
(
'express'
);
const
{
Sequelize
,
DataTypes
}
=
require
(
'sequelize'
);
const
{
config
}
=
require
(
'dotenv'
);
config

if
(

) {
throw
new
Error
(
'DATABASE_URL is not set'
);
}
const
sequelize
=
new
Sequelize
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
{

,
});
// Set up the models
const

const
Book
=
require
(
'./models/book'
)(sequelize
,
DataTypes);
// Create a new Express application
const
app
=

);
});
app

,
async
(req

=>
{
try
{
const

=
await

.json
(authors);
}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(
'Error fetching authors:'
,
error);
res
.status
(

)
.send
(

}
});
app

=>
{
const

,
});

}
catch
(error) {
console
.error
(

,
error);
res
.status

}
});
// Start the server
app
.listen
(port
,
()
=>
{
console
.log

);
});
This code sets up a simple API with two endpoints:
/authors
and
/books/:authorId
. The
/authors
endpoint returns a list of all the authors, and the
/books/:authorId
endpoint returns a list of books written by the specific author for the given
authorId
.
Run the application using the following command:
node
index.js
This will start the server at
http://localhost:3000
. Navigate to
http://localhost:3000/authors
and
http://localhost:3000/books/1
in your browser to check that the API works as expected.
Conclusion
In this guide, we set up a new Javascript project using
Express.js
and the
Sequelize
ORM, and connected it to a
Neon
Postgres database. We created a schema for the database, generated and ran migrations, and implemented API endpoints to query the database.

Stream changes from your Neon database to anywhere
Learn how to capture and stream changes and rows from your database to anywhere with Sequin
Neon's Logical Replication features makes it possible to detect every change in your database. It can be used to power read-replicas and backups, but can also be used to add streaming characteristics to Neon.
Sequin
uses Neon's logical replication to sends records and changes in your database to your applications and services, in real-time. It's designed to never miss an
insert
,
update
, or
delete
and provide exactly-once processing of all changes.
Changes are sent as messages via HTTP push (webhooks) or pull (SQS-like, with Sequin SDKs). Out of the box, you can start triggering side-effects when a new record is created, fan out work to cloud functions, or activate workflows in services like trigger.dev.
In this guide, we'll show you how to connect your Neon database to Sequin to start sending changes anywhere you need.
Prerequisites
A
Sequin account
A
Neon account
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin
Enable logical replication in Neon
Sequin uses the Write Ahead Log (WAL) to capture changes from your Postgres database. In this step, we'll enable logical replication for your Neon Postgres project.
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the Postgres
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from replica to logical for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to logical, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
Connect your Neon database to Sequin
After enabling logical replication on Neon, you'll now connect your Neon database to Sequin. Follow these steps:
In Neon, copy your database connection string. You can find the it by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It will look similar to this:
postgresql:
//
neondb_owner:AbC123dEf@ep
-
cool
-
darkness
-
123456
.us
-
east
-
2
.aws.neon.tech
/
neondb?sslmode
=
require
In the Sequin Console, click on the
Connect Database
button, and then auto-complete your database credentials by clicking the
Autofill with URL
button and pasting in your database connection string.
Use the SQL Editor in your Neon project to create a replication slot by executing the following SQL query:
SELECT
pg_create_logical_replication_slot(
'sequin_slot'
,
'pgoutput'
);
This creates a replication slot named
sequin_slot
.
Create a publication to indicate which tables will publish changes to the replication slot. Run the following SQL command:
CREATE
PUBLICATION sequin_pub
FOR
TABLE
table1, table2, table3;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
Back in the Sequin Console, enter the name of the replication slot (
sequin_slot
) and publication (
sequin_pub
) you just created. Then, name your database (e.g.
neondb
) and click
Create Database
.
With these steps completed, your Neon database is now connected to Sequin via a replication slot and publication. Sequin is now detecting changes to your tables.
Create a consumer
Set up a consumer in Sequin to stream changes from your database.
In the Sequin Console, navigate to the
Consumers
page and click
Create Consumer
.
Select the Neon database you just created and then select the specific table you want to process changes for.
Define any filters for the changes you want to capture. For example, you might want to only process orders with a value greater than a certain amount, or accounts with a certain status.
Choose whether you want your consumer to process
rows or changes
:
Rows
: Captures the latest state of records when a row is inserted or updated.
Changes
: Captures every
insert
,
update
, and
delete
, including
OLD
values for updates and deletes.
Select your preferred method for
receiving changes
:
HTTP Push
(Webhooks): Sequin sends changes to your specified endpoint.
HTTP Pull
(similar to SQS): Your application pulls changes from Sequin.
Enter the final details for your consumer:
Give your consumer a name (e.g.,
neon-changes-consumer
).
If using HTTP Push, provide the endpoint URL where Sequin should send the changes. You can also provide encrypted headers.
Optionally, set a timeout and add an endpoint path.
Click
Create Consumer
to finalize the setup.
Your consumer is now created and will start processing changes from your Neon database according to your specified configuration.
Where to next?
You're now using Sequin with Neon to capture and stream changes from your database. From here, you can tailor your implementation for your use case:
Use Sequin to trigger workflows in tools like Inngest or trigger.dev, activate side-effects in your app, setup audit logs, or generate denormalized views.
Tailor your consumer's
filtering
and settings to meet your requirements.
Try a
pull consumer
with
our SDKs
to completely manage how you retrieve changes at scale.

Schema migration with Neon Postgres and SQLAlchemy
Manage database migrations in your Python project with SQLAlchemy and Alembic
SQLAlchemy
is a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. SQLAlchemy provides a powerful way to interact with databases and manage database schema changes using
Alembic
, a lightweight database migration tool.
This guide demonstrates how to use SQLAlchemy/Alembic to manage schema migrations for a Neon Postgres database. We create a simple API using the
FastAPI
web framework and define database models using SQLAlchemy. We then generate and run migrations to manage schema changes over time.
Prerequisites
To follow along with this guide, you will need:
A Neon account. If you do not have one, sign up at
Neon
. Your Neon project comes with a ready-to-use Postgres database named
neondb
. We'll use this database in the following examples.
Python
installed on your local machine. We recommend using a newer version of Python, 3.8 or higher.
Setting up your Neon database
Initialize a new project
Log in to the Neon Console and navigate to the
Projects
section.
Select a project or click the
New Project
button to create a new one.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Keep your connection string handy for later use.
note
Neon supports both direct and pooled database connection strings. You can find a connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. A pooled connection string connects your application to the database via a PgBouncer connection pool, allowing for a higher number of concurrent connections. However, using a pooled connection string for migrations can be prone to errors. For this reason, we recommend using a direct (non-pooled) connection when performing migrations. For more information about direct and pooled connections, see
Connection pooling
.
Setting up the Web application
Set up the Python environment
To manage our project dependencies, we create a new Python virtual environment. Run the following commands in your terminal to set it up.
python
-m
venv
myenv
Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
# On macOS and Linux
source
myenv/bin/activate
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
With the virtual environment activated, we can create a new directory for our FastAPI project and install the required packages:
mkdir
guide-neon-sqlalchemy
&&
cd
guide-neon-sqlalchemy
pip
install
sqlalchemy
alembic
"psycopg2-binary"
pip
install
fastapi
uvicorn
python-dotenv
pip
freeze
>
requirements.txt
We installed SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and the
psycopg2-binary
package to connect to the Neon Postgres database. We the installed the
FastAPI
package to create the API endpoints and
uvicorn
as the web server. We then saved the installed packages to a
requirements.txt
file so the project can be easily recreated in another environment.
Set up the Database configuration
Create a
.env
file in the project root directory and add the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable to it. Use the connection string that you obtained from the Neon Console earlier:
# .env
DATABASE_URL
=
NEON_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING
We create an
app
directory at the project root to store the database models and configuration files.
mkdir
app
touch
guide-neon-sqlalchemy/app/__init__.py
Next, create a new file named
database.py
in the
app
subdirectory and add the following code:
# app/database.py
import
os
import
dotenv
from
sqlalchemy
import
create_engine
from
sqlalchemy
.
ext
.
declarative
import
declarative_base
from
sqlalchemy
.
orm
import
sessionmaker
dotenv
.
load_dotenv
()
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL
=
os
.
getenv
(
"DATABASE_URL"
)
engine
=
create_engine
(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal
=
sessionmaker
(autocommit
=
False
, autoflush
=
False
, bind
=
engine)
Base
=
declarative_base
()
This code sets up the database connection using SQLAlchemy. It reads the
DATABASE_URL
environment variable, creates a database engine, and defines a
SessionLocal
class for database sessions. The
Base
class is used as a base class for defining database models.
Defining data models and running migrations
Specify the data model
Create a new file named
models.py
in the
app
subdirectory and define the database models for your application:
# app/models.py
from
sqlalchemy
import
Column
,
Integer
,
String
,
Text
,
DateTime
,
ForeignKey
from
sqlalchemy
.
orm
import
relationship
from
sqlalchemy
.
sql
import
func
from
.
database
import
Base
class
Author
(
Base
):
__tablename__
=
"authors"
id
=
Column
(Integer, primary_key
=
True
, index
=
True
)
name
=
Column
(
String
(
100
), nullable
=
False
)
bio
=
Column
(Text)
created_at
=
Column
(
DateTime
(timezone
=
True
), server_default
=
func.
now
())
books
=
relationship
(
"Book"
, back_populates
=
"author"
)
class
Book
(
Base
):
__tablename__
=
"books"
id
=
Column
(Integer, primary_key
=
True
, index
=
True
)
title
=
Column
(
String
(
200
), nullable
=
False
)
author_id
=
Column
(Integer,
ForeignKey
(
"authors.id"
), nullable
=
False
)
created_at
=
Column
(
DateTime
(timezone
=
True
), server_default
=
func.
now
())
author
=
relationship
(
"Author"
, back_populates
=
"books"
)
This code defines two models:
Author
and
Book
. The
Author
model represents an author with fields for
name
,
bio
, and a
created_at
timestamp. The
Book
model represents a book with fields for
title
,
author
(as a foreign key to the
Author
model), and a
created_at
timestamp. The
relationship
function is used to define the one-to-many relationship between
Author
and
Book
.
Initialize Alembic
To initialize Alembic for managing database migrations, run the following command in your terminal:
alembic
init
alembic
This command creates a new directory named
alembic
with the necessary files for managing migrations. Open the
env.py
file in the
alembic
directory and update the
target_metadata
variable to include the models defined in the
models.py
file:
# alembic/env.py
from
app
.
models
import
Base
target_metadata
=
Base
.
metadata
We update the
alembic/env.py
file again to load the database URL from the
.env
file at project root and set it as the
sqlalchemy.url
configuration option.
# alembic/env.py
import
dotenv
import
os
dotenv
.
load_dotenv
()
config
.
set_main_option
(
'sqlalchemy.url'
, os.
getenv
(
'DATABASE_URL'
,
""
))
Generate the initial migration
To generate the initial migration based on the defined models, run the following command:
alembic
revision
--autogenerate
-m
"init-setup"
This command detects the
Author
and
Book
models and generates a new migration file in the
alembic/versions
directory.
Apply the migration
To apply the migration and create the corresponding tables in the Neon Postgres database, run the following command:
alembic
upgrade
head
This command executes the migration file and creates the necessary tables in the database.
Seed the database
To seed the database with some initial data, create a new file named
seed.py
in the project root and add the following code:
# seed.py
from
database
import
SessionLocal
from
models
import
Author
,
Book
def
seed_data
():
db
=
SessionLocal
()
# Create authors
authors

),
]
db
.
add_all

, author
=
authors[

"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"
, author
=
authors[
2
]),
]
db
.
add_all
(books)
db
.
commit
()
print
(
"Data seeded successfully."
)
if
__name__
==
"__main__"
:
seed_data
()
Now, run the
seed.py
script to seed the database with the initial data:
python
seed.py
Implement the web application
Create API endpoints
Create a file named
main.py
in the project root directory and define the FastAPI application with endpoints for interacting with authors and books:
# main.py
from
fastapi
import
FastAPI
,
Depends
from
sqlalchemy
.
orm
import
Session
import
uvicorn
from

,
Base
from

import
SessionLocal
,

.
create_all
(bind

()
def
get_db
():

()
try
:
yield
db
finally
:
db
.
close
()
@app
.
get
(

)
def
read_authors
(

(get_db)
):
authors
=
db
.
query
(Author).
all
()
return
authors
@app
.
get
(
"/books/
{author_id}
"
)
def
read_books
(
author_id
:
int
,
db
:
Session
=
Depends
(get_db)
):
books
=
db
.
query
(Book).
filter
(Book.author_id
==
author_id).
all
()
return
books
if
__name__
==
"__main__"
:
uvicorn
.
run
(app, host
=
"127.0.0.1"
, port
=
8000
)
This code defines endpoints for creating and retrieving authors and books. It uses SQLAlchemy's
Session
to interact with the database and Pydantic models (
schemas
) for request and response data validation and serialization.
Run the FastAPI server
To start the FastAPI server using
uvicorn
and test the application, run the following command:
python
main.py
Now, you can navigate to
http://localhost:8000/authors
in your browser to view the list of authors. To view the books by a specific author, navigate to
http://localhost:8000/books/{author_id}
where
{author_id}
is the ID of the author.
Applying schema changes
Let's demonstrate how to handle schema changes by adding a new field
country
to the
Author
model, to store the author's country of origin.
Update the data model
Open the
models.py
file and add a new field to the
Author
model:
# models.py
class
Author
(
Base
):
__tablename__
=
"authors"
id
=
Column
(Integer, primary_key
=
True
, index
=
True
)
name
=
Column
(
String
(
100
), nullable
=
False
)
bio
=
Column
(Text)
country
=
Column
(
String
(
100
))
created_at
=
Column
(
DateTime
(timezone
=
True
), server_default
=
func.
now
())
books
=
relationship
(
"Book"
, back_populates
=
"author"
)
Generate and run the migration
To generate a new migration file for the schema change, run the following command:
alembic
revision
--autogenerate
-m
"add-country-to-author"
This command detects the updated
Author
model and generates a new migration file to add the new field to the corresponding table in the database.
Now, to apply the migration, run the following command:
alembic
upgrade
head
Test the schema change
Restart the FastAPI development server.
python
main.py
Navigate to
http://localhost:8000/authors
in your browser to view the list of authors. You should see the new
country
field included in each author's record, reflecting the schema change.
Conclusion
In this guide, we demonstrated how to set up a FastAPI project with
Neon
Postgres, define database models using SQLAlchemy, generate migrations using Alembic, and run them. Alembic makes it easy to interact with the database and manage schema evolution over time.

Connect an SQLAlchemy application to Neon
Set up a Neon project in seconds and connect from an SQLAlchemy application
SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that provides application developers with the full power and flexibility of SQL. This guide describes how to create a Neon project and connect to it from SQLAlchemy.
Prerequisites:
To complete the steps in this topic, ensure that you have an SQLAlchemy installation with a Postgres driver. The following instructions use
psycopg2
, the default driver for Postgres in SQLAlchemy. For SQLAlchemy installation instructions, refer to the
SQLAlchemy Installation Guide
.
psycopg2
installation instructions are provided below.
To connect to Neon from SQLAlchemy:
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project. Save your connection details, including your password. They are required when defining connection settings.
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Install psycopg2
Psycopg2 is a popular python library for running raw Postgres queries.
For most operating systems, the quickest installation method is using the PIP package manager. For example:
pip
install
psycopg2-binary
For additional information about installing
psycopg2
, refer to the
psycopg2 installation documentation
.
Create the "hello neon" program
import
psycopg2
# Optional: tell psycopg2 to cancel the query on Ctrl-C
import
psycopg2
.
extras; psycopg2
.
extensions
.
set_wait_callback
(psycopg2.extras.wait_select)
# You can set the password to None if it is specified in a ~/.pgpass file
USERNAME
=
"alex"
PASSWORD
=
"AbC123dEf"

.
cursor
()
as
cur
:

.
execute
(
"SELECT 'hello neon';"
)
print
(cur.
fetchall
())
You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
note
This example was tested with Python 3 and psycopg2 version 2.9.3.
Create an SQLAlchemy engine for your Neon project
SQLAlchemy uses engine abstraction to manage database connections and exposes a
create_engine
function as the primary endpoint for engine initialization.
The following example creates an SQLAlchemy engine that points to your Neon branch:
from
sqlalchemy
import
create_engine
USERNAME
=
"alex"
PASSWORD
=
"AbC123dEf"
HOST
=
"ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech"
DATABASE
=
"dbname"
conn_str
=
f
'postgresql://
{
USERNAME
}
:
{
PASSWORD
}
@
{
HOST
}
/
{
DATABASE
}
?sslmode=require'
engine
=
create_engine
(conn_str)
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
For additional information about connecting from SQLAlchemy, refer to the following topics in the SQLAlchemy documentation:
Establishing Connectivity - the Engine
Connecting to PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy
SQLAlchemy connection errors
SQLAlchemy versions prior to 2.0.33 may reuse idle connections, leading to connection errors. If this occurs, you could encounter an
SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly
error. To resolve this, upgrade to SQLAlchemy 2.0.33 or later. For more details, see the
SQLAlchemy 2.0.33 changelog
.
If you encounter an
SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected
when connecting to the database, this typically happens because the application is trying to reuse a connection after the Neon compute has been suspended due to inactivity. To resolve this issue, try one of the following options:
Set the SQLAlchemy
pool_recycle
parameter to a value less than or equal to the scale to zero setting configured for your compute.
Set the SQLAlchemy
pool_pre_ping
parameter to
true
. This ensures that your engine checks if the connection is alive before executing a query.
For more details on the

Use StepZen with Neon
Learn how to use StepZen to build a GraphQL API for your Neon database
This guide was contributed by Roy Derks from StepZen
GraphQL has been around for years and is becoming increasingly popular among web developers. It is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data. GraphQL allows clients to access data flexibly and efficiently. However, building a GraphQL API often requires writing a lot of code and familiarizing yourself with a new framework. This guide shows how you can generate a GraphQL API for your Neon database in minutes using
StepZen
.
Why use Neon and StepZen together? Neon is serverless Postgres. Neon separates storage and compute to offer modern developer features such as scale-to-zero and database branching. With Neon, you can be up and running with a Postgres database in just a few clicks, and you can easily create and manage your database in the Neon Console and connect to it using
psql
or the
Neon SQL Editor
. What if you want to let clients consume your data through an API in a way that is both flexible and efficient? That's where StepZen comes in. StepZen is a GraphQL API platform that lets you build a GraphQL API for your Neon database in minutes. Just like Neon, it's serverless and offers a generous free plan.
Set up Neon
Before generating a GraphQL API, you must set up a Neon database, which you can do it in a few steps:
Sign in to Neon, or
sign up
if you do not yet have an account.
Select a Neon project. If you do not have one, see
Create a project
.
Create a database
or use the ready-to-use
dbname
database.
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
Using the connection string, you can seed the database with the data from the
init.sql
file, which you can find
here
.
Running the
init.sql
file creates the
address
,
customer
,
product
, and
order
tables and populates them with the data. It also creates tables that connect the
customer
table with the
address
table, and the
order
table with the
product
table.
You can seed the database directly from the terminal by running the following
psql
command:
psql
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
<
init.sql
The command takes a Neon connection string as the first argument and a file as the second argument.
In the terminal, you can see that the tables are created and populated with the data. You can also view the tables and data from the
Tables
page in the Neon Console.
Next, you will connect StepZen to the Neon database and use it to generate a GraphQL schema for the database.
Connect StepZen to Neon
To generate a GraphQL schema for the data in your Neon database, you need to connect StepZen to Neon. This can be done manually or by using the StepZen CLI.
The StepZen CLI can be installed with
npm
(or Yarn), and it must be installed globally:
npm
install
-g
stepzen
After you install the CLI, create a StepZen account. You can do this by navigating to
https://stepzen.com/
and clicking the
Start for Free
button.
To link your StepZen account to the CLI, log in using the following command:
stepzen
login
note
You can also use StepZen without creating an account. The difference is that you will have a public account, which means that your schema will be public, and everyone with the link can query data from your database. For more information, refer to the
StepZen documentation
.
Next, create a local directory for your StepZen workspace and navigate to the directory. For example:
mkdir
stpezen
cd
stepzen
Specify your data source with the
stepzen import
CLI. Answer the setup questions as shown below.
stepzen
import
postgresql

StepZen
The CLI has now created a GraphQL schema based on the tables and data in your Neon database. You can find the schema in the
stepzen
folder at the root of your project. The schema is generated in the
postgresql/index.graphql
file.
note
The
Automatically link types based on foreign key relationships using @materializer
step is essential, as it automatically links the tables based on foreign key relationships, which allows you to query data from the
customer
table and get related data from the
address
table.
The
config.yaml
file stores connection details for the Neon database. The StepZen CLI uses this file to connect to the Neon database. But you need to make two changes to the file:
configurationset:
-
configuration:
name:
postgresql_config
uri:
YOUR_NEON_DSN?user=YOUR_NEON_USERNAME
&
password
=
YOUR_NEON_PASSWORD
&
options
=
project
=
YOUR_NEON_PROJECT_ID
&
sslmode
=
require
As shown above, you need to append
&options=project=YOUR_NEON_PROJECT_ID
to the
uri
connection string. This is needed to establish a secure connection to the Neon database. The
project
option is the ID of the project in Neon. You can find the project ID in the Neon Console under
Settings
or in the URL of your project.
The next section explores the GraphQL API to see how the connection between the Neon Postgres database and StepZen works.
Explore the GraphQL API
The GraphQL schema that StepZen generates still needs to be deployed to the cloud before you are able to explore the GraphQL API. With StepZen, you have multiple options to deploy your schema. You can deploy it to the StepZen cloud or run it locally using Docker. This guide uses the StepZen cloud, which the fastest way to get started.
To deploy the schema to the StepZen cloud, run the following command:
stepzen
start
After the schema is deployed, you can explore the GraphQL API in the
StepZen dashboard
.
From the dashboard, you can view the GraphQL schema, try out queries and mutations, and generate code snippets for your favorite programming language.
The CLI also outputs the URL of your GraphQL API endpoint. You can use this endpoint to query your API from other tools or applications.
It's time to start querying the GraphQL API. Start by querying the
customer
table. You can do this by writing the following query on the left-hand side of the dashboard:
{
getCustomerList {
name
email
}
}
The GraphQL API will retrieve the
name
and
email
fields from the
customer
table. The result looks like this:
{
"data"
:
{
"getCustomerList"
:
[
{
"name"
:
"Lucas Bill"
,
"email"
:
"lucas.bill@example.com"
}
,
{
// ...
}
]
}
}
In GraphQL, the result has the same shape as the query (or other operation) you used to retrieve it. The GraphQL API will only retrieve the fields from the database that are present in the query. The query sent to the Neon database has the following shape:
SELECT
name
, email
FROM
public.customer
The following section dives deeper into the GraphQL API, showing how GraphQL API queries are translated to SQL.
From GraphQL query to SQL
You have explored the GraphQL API, learning how to query data from the Neon database. But how does this work? How is a GraphQL query translated to an SQL query that runs on your Neon database?
In the previous example, StepZen only requests the fields in the query, improving the GraphQL API's performance. Requesting all fields from the database makes no sense if only a few are requested.
Below, you can see a snippet of the
getCustomerList
query in the
postgresql/index.graphql
file:
type
Query
{
getCustomerList: [
Customer
]
@dbquery
(
type:
"postgresql"
schema:
"public"
table:
"customer"
configuration:
"postgresql_config"
)
}
The
getCustomerList
query defined in the GraphQL schema returns an array of the type
Customer
.
The
@dbquery
directive identifies the query as a database query
type
defines the type of database
schema
defines the schema
table
defines the table in the database
configuration
defines the name of the connection configuration used to connect to the database
Earlier, the CLI created connections based on foreign key relationships. For example, the
order
table has a foreign key relationship with the
customer
table. This means that you can query data from the
order
table, and get the related data from the
customer
table. You can query the customer linked to an order like this:
{
getOrderList {
id
shippingcost
customer {
name
email
}
}
}
In addition to the
id
and
shippingcost
fields, the
name
and
email
fields are requested from the
customer
table. So how does the query get the
customer
field?
The
getOrderList
query is defined in the GraphQL schema, and returns a list of the type
Order
with a field called
customerid
. This relationship is defined as a foreign key in the database and the GraphQL schema has a field called
customer
, which is linked to the
customerid
field.
type
Order
{
carrier:
String
createdat:
Date
!
customer:
Customer
@materializer
(query:
"getCustomer"
, arguments: [{
name
:
"id"
,
field
:
"customerid"
}])
customerid:
Int
!
id:
Int
!
lineitemList: [
Lineitem
]
@materializer
(query:
"getLineitemUsingOrderid"
)
shippingcost:
Float
trackingid:
String
}
The
@materializer
directive links the
customer
field to the
customerid
field. The
query
argument is the name of the query that retrieves the data, which in this case is
getCustomer
. The
arguments
argument is an array of objects that define the arguments passed to the query. In this case, the
id
argument is passed to the
getCustomer
query, and the value of the
id
argument is the value of the
customerid
field.
When you retrieve a list of orders from the database, you can include the
customer
field for each order. StepZen then executes the
getCustomer
query with the
id
argument set to the value of the
customerid
field.
type
Query
{
getCustomer(id:
Int
!
):
Customer
@dbquery
(
type:
"postgresql"
schema:
"public"
table:
"customer"
configuration:
"postgresql_config"
)
}
This GraphQL query is translated to the following SQL query, which is run on the Neon Postgres database.
SELECT
name
, email
FROM
public.customer
WHERE
id
=
$
1
And together with the previous query, it is translated to the following SQL query for the Neon Postgres database:
SELECT
id, shippingcost, customerid
FROM
public.order
SELECT
name
, email
FROM
public.customer
WHERE
id
=
$
1
StepZen reuses SQL queries or merges queries when possible to retrieve data from the Neon database more efficiently. For example, if you request the
customer
field for multiple orders, StepZen only executes the
getCustomer
query once for every recurring value of
customerid
.
note
In addition to having StepZen generate the query that is sent to the Neon database, you can also define a raw query in the GraphQL schema. Defining a raw query is useful when you want to query data from multiple tables or when you want to use a more complex query. You can find an example in the
getOrderUsingCustomerid
query in the
postgresql/index.graphql
file.
Conclusion
In this guide, you have learned how to generate a GraphQL API from a Neon database. You have used StepZen, which offers GraphQL-as-a-Service and a CLI to generate GraphQL APIs from data sources such as databases and REST APIs. Using StepZen, you can quickly generate a GraphQL API from a Neon database and use it to query data from the database. You also looked at how StepZen translates queries to the GraphQL API into SQL queries that run on your Neon database.

Managing your data and schemas in the Neon Console
Use the Tables page to easily view, edit, and manage your data and schemas
The
Tables
page in the Neon Console offers a dynamic, visual interface for managing data and schemas. Fully interactive, this view lets you add, update, and delete records, filter data, modify columns, drop or truncate tables, export data in both .json and .csv formats, and manage schemas, tables, views, and enums.
note
The
Tables
page is powered by a Drizzle Studio integration. For tracking updates, see
Tables page enhancements and updates
.
Edit records
Edit individual entries directly within the table interface. Click on a cell to modify its contents. You don't have to press
Enter
(though you can). Just move your cursor to the next cell you want to modify. Click
Save x changes
when you're done.
Add records
Add new records to your tables using the
Add record
button.
A couple of things to note:
You need to hit
Enter
for your input to register. When editing existing fields, you don't have to do this. But for new fields, if you tab to the next cell, you'll lose your input.
You can leave
DEFAULT
fields untouched and the cell will inherit the right value based on your schema definition. For example, defaults for boolean fields are automatically applied when you click
Save changes
.
Toggle columns
You can simplify your view by hiding (or showing) individual columns in the table. You're not modifying content here; deselect a checked column to hide it, and re-select the column to show it again. Your selections are saved as a persistent filter.
Add filters
Filters let you store simplified views of your data that you can come back to later. You can use dropdown-filtering to select columns, conditions, and input text for the filter.
Each new filter is added as a
View
under your list of Tables.
Delete records
Use the checkboxes to mark any unwanted records for deletion, or use the select-all checkbox for bulk deletion. Click
Delete x records
to complete the process.
Export data
You can also use the checkboxes to mark records for export. Select the records you want to include in your export, then choose
Export selected...
from the export dropdown.
Or just choose
Export all..
to download the entire contents of the table.
You can export to either JSON or CSV.
Manage schemas
In addition to managing data, you can manage your database schema directly from the
Tables
page. Schema management options include:
Creating, altering, and dropping schemas
Creating and altering tables
Creating and altering views
Creating enums
Refreshing the database schema
Tables page updates
The
Tables
page in the Neon Console is powered by a Drizzle Studio integration. You can check the Drizzle Studio integration version in your browser by inspecting the Tables page. For example, in Chrome, right-click, select
Inspect
, and go to the
Console
tab to view the current
Tables version
. You can cross-reference this version with the
Neon Drizzle Studio Integration Changelog
to track updates.

Time Travel
Learn how to query point-in-time connections against your data's history
To help review your data's history, Time Travel lets you connect to any selected point in time within your restore window and then run queries against that connection. This capability is part of Neon's instant restore feature, which maintains a history of changes through Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records.
You can use Time Travel from two places in the Neon Console, and from the Neon CLI:
SQL Editor
— Time Travel is built into the SQL editor letting you switch between queries of your current data and previous iterations of your data in the same view.
Restore
— Time Travel Assist is also built into the instant restore flow where it can help you make sure you've targeted the correct restore point before you restore a branch.
Neon CLI
— Use the Neon CLI to quickly establish point-in-time connections for automated scripts or command-line-based data analysis.
How Time Travel works
Time Travel leverages Neon's instant branching capability to create a temporary branch and compute at the selected point in time, which are automatically removed once you are done querying against this point-in-time connection. The computes are ephemeral: they are not listed on the
Branches
page or in a CLI or API list branches request.
However, you can see the history of operations related to the creation and deletion of branches and ephemeral computes on the
Operations
page:
start_compute
create_branch
delete_timeline
suspend_compute
How long do ephemeral endpoints remain active
The ephemeral endpoints are created with a .50 CU compute size, which has 0.50 vCPU size with 2 GB of RAM. An ephemeral compute remains active for as long as you keep running queries against it. After 30 seconds of inactivity, the timeline is deleted and the endpoint is removed.
Restore window
You are only able to run Time Travel queries that fall within your restore window, which starts at 24 hours for Free Plan users, up to 7 days for Launch, 14 days for Scale, and 30 days for Business plan users.
You cannot select a time outside your current restore window.
To change your restore window, see
Configure restore window
.
Data integrity
Time Travel only allows non-destructive read-only queries. You cannot alter historical data in any way. If you try to run any query that could alter historical data, you will get an error message like the following:
Time Travel with the SQL Editor
Time Travel in the SQL Editor offers a non-destructive way to explore your database's historical data through read-only queries. By toggling Time Travel in the editor, you switch from querying your current data to querying against a selected point within your restore window.
You can use this feature to help with scenarios like:
Investigating anomolies
Assessing the impact of new features
Troubleshooting
Compliance auditing
Here's an example of a completed Time Travel query.
Time Travel Assist with instant restore
Time Travel Assist is also available from the
Restore
page, as part of the
Instant restore
feature. Before completing a restore operation, it's a good idea to use Time Travel Assist to verify that you've targetted the correct restore point.
An SQL editor is built into the
Restore
page for this purpose. When you make your branch and timestamp selection to restore a branch, this selection can also be used as the point-in-time connection to query against.
Here is an example of a completed query:
How to use Time Travel
Here is how to use Time Travel from both the
SQL Editor
and from the
Restore
page:
SQL Editor
Instant restore
CLI
In the Neon Console, open the
SQL Editor
.
Use the
Time Travel
toggle to enable querying against an earlier point in time.
Use the Date & Time selector to choose a point within your restore window.
Write your read-only query in the editor, then click
Run
. You don't have to include time parameters in the query; the query is automatically targeted to your selected timestamp.
Billing considerations
The ephemeral endpoints used to run your Time Travel queries do contribute to your consumption usage totals for the billing period, like any other active endpoint that consumes resources.
A couple of details to note:
The endpoints are shortlived. They are suspended 30 seconds after you stop querying.
Ephemeral endpoints are created with a .50 CU compute size, which has 0.50 vCPU size with 2 GB of RAM. This is Neon's second smallest compute size. For more about compute sizes in Neon, see

Trigger serverless functions
Use Inngest to trigger serverless functions from your Neon database changes
Combining your serverless Neon database with
Inngest
enables you to
trigger serverless functions
running on Vercel, AWS, and Cloudflare Worker
based on database changes.
By enabling your serverless functions to react to database changes, you open the door to many use cases. From onboarding to ETL and AI workflows, the possibilities are endless.
This guide describes setting up a Neon database, configuring the Inngest integration, and connecting your Serverless functions to your Neon database with Inngest. It covers:
Creating a Neon project and enabling
Logical Replication
.
Configuring the Inngest integration on your Neon database.
Configure your Vercel, AWS, or Cloudflare functions to react to your Neon database changes using Inngest.
Prerequisites
A Neon account. If you do not have one, see
Sign up
for instructions.
An Inngest account. You can create a free Inngest account by
signing up
.
Create a Neon project
If you do not have one already, create a Neon project:
Navigate to the
Projects
page in the Neon Console.
Click
New Project
.
Specify your project settings and click
Create Project
.
Create a table in Neon
To create a table, navigate to the
SQL Editor
in the
Neon Console
:
In the SQL Editor, run the following queries to create a
users
table and insert some data:
CREATE
TABLE
users
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
name
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
email
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
created_at
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
INSERT INTO
users (
name
, email)
VALUES
(
'Alice'
,
'alice@example.com'
),
(
'Bob'
,
'bob@example.com'
),
(
'Charlie'
,
'charlie@example.com'
),
(
'Dave'
,
'dave@example.com'
),
(
'Eve'
,
'eve@example.com'
);
Enabling Logical Replication on your database
The Inngest Integration relies on Neon’s Logical Replication feature to get notified upon database changes.
Navigate to your Neon Project using the Neon Console and open the
Settings
>
Logical Replication
page. From here, follow the instructions to enable Logical Replication:
Configuring the Inngest integration
Your Neon database is now ready to work with Inngest.
To configure the Inngest Neon Integration, navigate to the Inngest Platform, open the
Integrations page
, and follow the instructions of the
Neon Integration installation wizard
:
The Inngest Integration requires Postgres admin credentials to complete its setup.
These credentials are not stored and are only used during the installation process
.
You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
Triggering Serverless functions from database changes
Any changes to your Neon database are now dispatched to your Inngest account.
To enable your Serverless functions to react to database changes, we will:
Install the Inngest client to your Serverless project
Expose a serverless endpoint enabling Inngest to discover your Serverless functions
Configure your Serverless application environment variables
Connect a Serverless function to any change performed to the
users
table.
1. Configuring the Inngest client
First, install the Inngest client:
npm
i
inngest
Then, create a
inngest/client.ts
(
or
inngest/client.js
) file as follows:
// inngest/client.ts
import
{ Inngest }
from
'inngest'
;
export
const
inngest
=
new
Inngest
({ id
:
'neon-inngest-project'
});
2. Listen for new
users
rows
Any change performed on our Neon database will trigger an
Inngest Event
as follows:
{
"name"
:
"db/users.inserted"
,
"data"
:
{
"new"
:
{
"id"
:
{
"data"
:
2
,
"encoding"
:
"i"
}
,
"name"
:
{
"data"
:
"Charly"
,
"encoding"
:
"t"
}
,
"email"
:
{
"data"
:
"charly@inngest.com"
,
"encoding"
:
"t"
}
}
,
"table"
:
"users"
,
"txn_commit_time"
:
"2024-09-24T14:41:19.75149Z"
,
"txn_id"
:
36530520
}
,
"ts"
:
1727146545006
}
Inngest enables you to create
Inngest Functions
that react to Inngest events (here, database changes).
Let's create an Inngest Function listening for
"db/users.inserted"
events:
// inngest/functions/new-user.ts
import
{ inngest }
from
'../client'
export
newUser = inngest.createFunction(
{ id
:
"new-user"
}
,
{ event
:
"db/users.inserted"
}
,
async
({ event
,
step })
=>
{
const
user
=
event
.
data
.new
await
step
.run
(
"send-welcome-email"
,
async
()
=>
{
// Send welcome email
await
sendEmail
({
template
:
"welcome"
,
to
:
user
.email
,
});
});
await
step
.sleep
(
"wait-before-tips"
,
"3d"
);
await
step
.run
(
"send-new-user-tips-email"
,
async
()
=>
{
// Follow up with some helpful tips
await
sendEmail
({
template
:
"new-user-tips"
,
to
:
user
.email
,
});
});
}
)
3. Exposing your Serverless Functions to Inngest
To allow Inngest to run your Inngest Functions, add the following Serverless Function, which serves as a router:
Vercel
AWS Lambda
Cloudflare Workers
// src/app/api/inngest/route.ts
import
{ serve }
from
'inngest/next'
;
import
{ inngest }
from
'@lib/inngest/client'
;
import
newUsers
from
'@lib/inngest/functions/newUsers'
;
// Your own functions
export
const
{
GET
,
POST
,
PUT
}
=
serve
({
client
:
inngest
,
functions
:
[newUsers]
,
});
note
You can find more information about serving Inngest Functions in
Inngest's documentation
.
4. Configuring your Serverless application
We can now configure your Serverless application to sync with the Inngest Platform:
Vercel:
Configure the
Inngest Vercel Integration
.
AWS Lambda:
Configure a
Lambda function URLs
and
sync your serve Lambda with Inngest
.
Cloudflare Workers:
Add the proper environment variables
to your Cloudflare Pages project and
sync with Inngest
.
5. Testing our Serverless function
We are now all set!
Go to the
Tables
page in the Neon Console and add a new record to the
users
table:
You should see a new run of the
new-user
function appear on the
Inngest Platform
:
Going further
Your Serverless functions can now react to your Neon database changes.
In addition to being good for system design, Inngest has some special features that work great with database triggers:
Fan-out
: Lets
one database event start multiple functions
at the same time. For example, when a new user is added, it could send a welcome email and set up a free trial, all at once.
Batching
Groups many database changes together
to handle them more efficiently. It's useful when you need to update lots of things at once, like when working with online stores.
Flow control
: Helps manage how often functions run. It can slow things down to
avoid overloading systems, or wait a bit to avoid doing unnecessary work
. This is helpful when working with other services that have limits on how often you can use them.

Connect from TypeORM to Neon
Learn how to connect to Neon from TypeORM
TypeORM is an open-source ORM that lets you to manage and interact with your database. This guide covers the following topics:
Connect to Neon from TypeORM
Use connection pooling with TypeORM
Connection timeouts
Connect to Neon from TypeORM
To establish a basic connection from TypeORM to Neon, perform the following steps:
Retrieve your Neon connection string. You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Select a branch, a user, and the database you want to connect to. A connection string is constructed for you.
The connection string includes the user name, password, hostname, and database name.
Update the TypeORM's DataSource initialization in your application to the following:
import
{ DataSource }
from
'typeorm'
;
export
const
AppDataSource
=
new
DataSource
({
type
:
'postgres'
,
url
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
ssl
:
true
,
entities
:
[
/*list of entities*/
]
,
});
Add a
DATABASE_URL
variable to your
.env
file and set it to the Neon connection string that you copied in the previous step. We also recommend adding
?sslmode=require
to the end of the connection string to ensure a
secure connection
.
Your setting will appear similar to the following:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
tip
TypeORM leverages a
node-postgres
Pool instance to connect to your Postgres database. Installing
pg-native
and setting the
NODE_PG_FORCE_NATIVE
environment variable to
true
switches the
pg
driver to
pg-native
, which, according to some users, produces noticeably faster response times.
Use connection pooling with TypeORM
Serverless functions can require a large number of database connections as demand increases. If you use serverless functions in your application, we recommend that you use a pooled Neon connection string, as shown:
# Pooled Neon connection string
DATABASE_URL=
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
A pooled Neon connection string adds
-pooler
to the endpoint ID, which tells Neon to use a pooled connection. You can add
-pooler
to your connection string manually or copy a pooled connection string from the
Connect to your database
modal, which you can access by clicking
Connect
on your
Project Dashboard
. Enable the
Connection pooling
toggle to add the
-pooler
suffix.
Connection timeouts
A connection timeout that occurs when connecting from TypeORM to Neon causes an error similar to the following:
Error: P1001: Can't reach database server at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`
Please make sure your database server is running at `ep-white-thunder-826300.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech`:`5432`.
This error most likely means that the TypeORM query timed out before the Neon compute was activated.
A Neon compute has two main states:
Active
and
Idle
. Active means that the compute is currently running. If there is no query activity for 5 minutes, Neon places a compute into an idle state by default.
When you connect to an idle compute from TypeORM, Neon automatically activates it. Activation typically happens within a few seconds but added latency can result in a connection timeout. To address this issue, you can adjust your Neon connection string by adding a
connect_timeout
parameter. This parameter defines the maximum number of seconds to wait for a new connection to be opened. The default value is 5 seconds. A higher setting may provide the time required to avoid connection timeouts. For example:
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10"
note
A
connect_timeout
setting of 0 means no timeout.

Media storage with Uploadcare
Store files via Uploadcare and track metadata in Neon
Uploadcare
provides an cloud platform designed to simplify file uploading, processing, storage, and delivery via a fast CDN. It offers tools that manage and optimize media like images, videos, and documents for your applications.
This guide demonstrates how to integrate Uploadcare with Neon by storing file metadata in your Neon database while using Uploadcare for file uploads and storage.
Setup steps
Create a Neon project
Navigate to
pg.new
to create a new Neon project.
Copy the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For more information, see
Connect from any application
.
Create an Uploadcare account and project
Sign up for an account at
Uploadcare.com
.
Create a new project within your Uploadcare dashboard.
Navigate to your project's
API Keys
section.
Note your
Public Key
and
Secret Key
. They are needed to interact with the Uploadcare API and widgets.
Create a table in Neon for file metadata
We need to create a table in Neon to store metadata about the files uploaded to Uploadcare. This table will include fields for the file's unique identifier, URL, upload timestamp, and any other relevant metadata you want to track.
You can run the create table statement using the
Neon SQL Editor
or from a client such as
psql
that is connected to your Neon database. Here is an example SQL statement to create a simple table for file metadata which includes a file ID, URL, user ID, and upload timestamp:
CREATE
TABLE
IF
NOT
EXISTS
uploadcare_files (
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
file_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
UNIQUE
,
file_url
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
user_id
TEXT
NOT NULL
,
upload_timestamp
TIMESTAMPTZ
DEFAULT
NOW
()
);
Run the SQL statement. You can add other relevant columns (file size, content type, etc.) depending on your application needs.
Securing metadata with RLS
If you use
Neon's Row Level Security (RLS)
, remember to apply appropriate access policies to the
uploadcare_files
table. This controls who can view or modify the object references stored in Neon based on your RLS rules.
Note that these policies apply
only
to the metadata stored in Neon. Access to the actual files is managed by Uploadcare's access controls and settings.
Upload files to Uploadcare and store metadata in Neon
You can integrate file uploads using any of Uploadcare's
many options
, which include UI widgets and SDKs tailored for specific languages and frameworks. For the examples in this guide, we will use the Uploadcare API directly. Feel free to choose the integration method that best fits your project; the fundamental approach of storing metadata in Neon remains the same.
JavaScript
Python
For this example, we'll build a simple Node.js server using
Hono
to handle file uploads. It will use the
@uploadcare/upload-client
package to upload files to Uploadcare and
@neondatabase/serverless
package to save metadata into your Neon database.
First, install the necessary dependencies:
npm
install
@uploadcare/upload-client
@neondatabase/serverless
@hono/node-server
hono
Create a
.env
file in your project root and add your Uploadcare and Neon connection details which you obtained in the previous steps:
UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY
=
your_uploadcare_public_key
DATABASE_URL
=
your_neon_database_connection_string
The following code snippet demonstrates this workflow:
import
{ serve }
from
'@hono/node-server'
;
import
{ Hono }
from
'hono'
;
import
{ uploadFile }

Explanation
Setup:
It initializes the Neon database client and the Hono web framework. It relies on environment variables (
DATABASE_URL
,
UPLOADCARE_PUBLIC_KEY
) being set, via a
.env
file.
Authentication:
A placeholder
authMiddleware
is included.
Crucially
, this needs to be replaced with real authentication logic. It currently just sets a static
userId
for demonstration.
Upload Endpoint (
/upload
):
It expects a
POST
request with
multipart/form-data
.
It retrieves the user ID set by the middleware.
It extracts the
file
data and
fileName
from the form data.
It uploads the file content directly to Uploadcare.
Upon successful upload, Uploadcare returns details including a unique
uuid
and a
cdnUrl
.
It executes an
INSERT
statement using the Neon serverless driver to save the
uuid
,
cdnUrl
, and the
userId
into a
uploadcare_files
table in your database.
It sends a JSON response back to the client containing the
fileUrl
from Uploadcare.
Testing the upload endpoint
Once your server (Node.js or Python example) is running, you can test the
/upload
endpoint to ensure files are correctly sent to Uploadcare and their metadata is stored in Neon.
You'll need to send a
POST
request with
multipart/form-data
containing a field named
file
.
Open your terminal and run a command similar to this, replacing
/path/to/your/image.jpg
with the actual path to a file you want to upload:
curl
-X
POST
http://localhost:3000/upload
\
-F
"file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"
\
-F
"fileName=my-test-image.jpg"
-X POST
: Specifies the HTTP method.
http://localhost:3000/upload
: The URL of your running server's endpoint.
-F "file=@/path/to/your/image.jpg"
: Specifies a form field named
file
. The
@
symbol tells cURL to read the content from the specified file path.
-F "fileName=my-test-image.jpg"
: Sends an additional form field
fileName
.
Expected outcome:
You should receive a JSON response similar to:
{
"success"
:
true
,
"fileUrl"
:
"https://ucarecdn.com/xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx/"
}
You can now integrate calls to this
/upload
endpoint from various parts of your application (e.g., web clients, mobile apps, backend services) to handle file uploads.
Accessing file metadata and files
Storing metadata in Neon allows your application to easily retrieve references to the files uploaded to Uploadcare.
Query the
uploadcare_files
table from your application's backend when needed.
Example SQL query:
Retrieve files for user 'user_123':
SELECT
id,
-- Your database primary key
file_id,
-- Uploadcare UUID
file_url,
-- Uploadcare CDN URL
user_id,
-- The user associated with the file
upload_timestamp
FROM
uploadcare_files
WHERE
user_id
=
'user_123'
;
-- Use actual authenticated user ID
Using the data:
The query returns rows containing the file metadata stored in Neon.
The crucial piece of information is the
file_url
. This is the direct link (CDN URL) to the file stored on Uploadcare.
You can use this
file_url
in your application (e.g., in frontend
<img>
tags, API responses, download links) wherever you need to display or provide access to the file.
This pattern separates file storage and delivery (handled by Uploadcare) from structured metadata management (handled by Neon).

Neon and Vercel overview
Learn about different options for integrating Neon with Vercel
Neon supports different options for integrating Neon and Vercel, including a native integration that you can install from the Vercel Marketplace, a "previews integration" that creates a database branch with every pull request, and a manual setup option. If you're currently a Vercel Postgres user, you'll also find information below about the upcoming transition from Vercel Postgres to Neon.
Option 1: Vercel Native Integration
This integration is intended for Vercel users who want to add Neon Postgres to their Vercel project as a
first-party native integration
. The integration creates a Neon Postgres account for you if you do not have one. You get access to Neon features and plans.
Billing is managed through Vercel
. The integration also supports automatic creation of a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment so that you can preview application and database changes together without impacting your production database.

Option 2: Add the Postgres Previews Integration
This integration is intended for users who are registered with Neon directly. The
Postgres Previews Integration
is a
connectable account integration
that connects your Vercel project to a Neon database and creates a database branch with each Vercel preview deployment.

Vercel has now completed transitioning almost all Vercel Postgres stores to the Native Vercel Integration for Neon Postgres.
You can now manage your databases via the Native Vercel Integration from the
Storage
tab on your Vercel Dashboard and in the Neon Console.
For those who have transitioned from Vercel Postgres to Neon, welcome! We're glad you're here. We've prepared a

Use WunderGraph with Neon
Leverage the power of Neon and WunderGraph to build fully serverless apps in minutes
This guide was contributed by the team at WunderGraph
WunderGraph is an open-source Backend for Frontend (BFF) framework designed to optimize developer workflows through API composition. Developers can use this framework to compose multiple APIs into a single unified interface and generate typesafe API clients that include authentication and file uploads. This guide shows how you can pair WunderGraph with your Neon database to accelerate application development.
With WunderGraph, you can easily introspect your data sources and combine them within your virtual graph. WunderGraph treats APIs as dependencies. You can easily turn your Neon database into a GraphQL API or expose it via JSON-RPC or REST. With an easy-to-deploy Postgres database like Neon, you can now have a 100% serverless stack and build your own stateful serverless apps on the edge.
This guide demonstrates setting up a full-stack app with Neon and WunderGraph, securely exposing Neon to your Next.js frontend in under 15 minutes. While WunderGraph and Neon are compatible with a variety of frontend clients, this demo focuses on using Next.js.

Connect Neon and Wundergraph
Now that your database has some data, navigate back to WunderGraph Cloud.
Select the project you just created and navigate to the
Settings
page.
Select the
Integrations
tab and click
Connect Neon
.
You are directed to Neon to authorize WunderGraph. Review the permissions and click
Authorize
to continue.
You are directed back to WunderGraph Cloud. If you are a part of multiple organizations, you are asked to select the organization to connect with Neon.
Select the Neon project and WunderGraph project that you want to connect, and click
Connect Projects
.
Your Neon and Wundergraph projects are now connected.
important
WunderGraph creates a role named
wundergraph-$project_id
in the Neon project that you selected during the integration process. Please do not delete or change the password for this role.
WunderGraph configures a environment variable called
NEON_DATABASE_URL
. Please use this variable wherever you need to provide a database URL.
Set up the WunderGraph project locally
The following steps describe how to set up your Wundergraph project locally and configure access to Neon.
In WunderGraph Cloud, select your project and click
View Git repository
to view your WunderGraph project repository.
Clone the repository and open it in your IDE. For example:
git
clone
https://github.com/
<
use
r
>
/wundergraph.git
cd
wundergraph
code
.
After the project is cloned, run the following commands in your project directory:
npm
install
&&
npm
run
dev
These commands install the required dependencies and start your project locally.
Inside the
.wundergraph
directory, open the
wundergraph.config.ts
file and add Neon as a datasource, as shown below, or simply replace the existing code with this code:
import
{
configureWunderGraphApplication
,
introspect
,
authProviders
,
EnvironmentVariable
,
}
from
'@wundergraph/sdk'
;
import
operations
from
'./wundergraph.operations'
;
import
server
from
'./wundergraph.server'
;
const
spaceX
=
introspect
.graphql
({
apiNamespace
:
'spacex'
,
url
:
'https://spacex-api.fly.dev/graphql/'
,
});
// Add your neon datasource
const
neon
=
introspect
.postgresql
({
apiNamespace
:
'neon'
,
//Your database URL can be found in the Neon Console
databaseURL
:
new
EnvironmentVariable
(
'NEON_DATABASE_URL'
)
,
});
configureWunderGraphApplication
({
// Add neon inside your APIs array
apis
:
[spaceX
,
neon]
,
server
,
operations
,
codeGenerators
:
[
{
templates
:
[
...
templates
.
typescript
.all]
,
}
,
]
,
});
Write an operation that turns your Neon database into an API that exposes data that you can pass through the frontend. To do so, navigate to the
operations
folder inside your
.wundergraph
directory and create a new file called
Users.graphql
.
info
With WunderGraph you can write operations in either GraphQL or TypeScript.
Inside your
Users.graphql
file, add the following code:
{
neon_findFirstusers {
id
name
email
}
}
This operation queries your Neon database using GraphQL and exposes the data via JSON-RPC. In the next section, you will add the operation to the frontend.
Configure the frontend
This section describes how to configure the frontend application.
In your local project, navigate to the
pages
directory and open the
index.tsx
file.
In the
index.tsx
file, make the following three changes or replace the existing code with the code shown below:
Retrieve the data from the
Users
endpoint using the
UseQuery
hook.
On line 62, update the copy to read: "This is the result of your
Users
Query".
On line 66, pass the
users
variable through to the frontend.
import
{ NextPage }
from
'next'
;
import
{ useQuery
,
withWunderGraph }
from
'../components/generated/nextjs'
;
const
Home
:
NextPage
=
()
=>
{
const
dragons
=
useQuery
({
operationName
:
'Dragons'
,
});
// We want to write this hook to get the data from our Users operation
const
users
=
useQuery
({
operationName
:
'Users'
,
});
const

Run the application
Run
npm run dev
.
Navigate to
http://localhost:3000
when the application is finished building. If your application runs successfully, you should see the result of your User's operation.
To take the setup one step further, commit the changes to your GitHub repository and merge them into your
main
branch.
After you merge the changes, navigate to
WunderGraph Cloud
and view out the
Deployments
tab. You should see that a deployment was triggered. Give the deployment a few seconds to finish.
When deployment is ready, navigate to the
Operations
tab. You should see the new endpoint that you created and added to your application. Click it to see your data in real time.
Key takeaways
This guide provided a brief demonstration showcasing the capabilities of Neon and WunderGraph, which enable you to turn your Neon database into an API exposed via JSON-RPC and rapidly deploy fully serverless apps on the edge in a matter of minutes. The power of Neon with WunderGraph lies in simplifying the development process, allowing you to focus on creating valuable and efficient applications.
In under 15 minutes, you were able to:
Create a WunderGraph Cloud account
Create a Next.js project hosted in a region near you
Set up a Neon database with sample data
Connect your WunderGraph application with your Neon database
Add Neon to your WunderGraph project using a code first approach
Write a GraphQL operation to query your Neon database
Update the frontend to display the results of your GraphQL operation securely using JSON-RPC
Commit your changes and trigger a deployment without a CI/CD pipeline or Devops team
View your new operations in real time with real-time metrics
If you had trouble with any of the steps outlined above, refer to the video guide below.

Import Data Assistant
beta
Move your database to Neon using our automated import tool
When you're ready to move your data to Neon, our Import Data Assistant can help you automatically copy your existing database to Neon. You only need to provide a connection string to get started.
Beta
Import Data Assistant
is in beta and ready to use. We're actively improving it based on feedback from developers like you. Share your experience in our
Discord
or via the
Neon Console
.
Migrate between Neon projects
You can also use the
Import Data Assistant
to migrate data between Neon projects. This is useful if you want to upgrade to a newer Postgres version (for example, from Postgres 16 to 17), or move your database to a different region. Just create a new project with the desired Postgres version or region, then use the database connection string from your existing Neon project to import the data into the new one.
Ways to import
The Import Data Assistant always creates a
new branch
for your imported data. There are two ways to launch the import:
From the Projects page:
Start from the project list to create a new project and import your data into a new branch as part of the flow.
From within a project:
Use the Getting Started widget on a project dashboard to import your data into a new branch of the existing project.
Both options use the same automated import process — just provide your database connection string and we'll handle the rest.
Before you start
You'll need:
A
Neon account
. Sign up at
Neon
if you don't have one.
A
connection string
to your current database in this format:
postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode
=require
Admin privileges
on your source database. We recommend using a superuser or a user with the necessary
CREATE
,
SELECT
,
INSERT
, and
REPLICATION
privileges.
A database
smaller than 10 GB
in size for automated import
important
If your database is larger than 10 GB and you need help,
contact us
.
Check Compatibility
Enter your database connection string and we'll verify:
Database size is within the current 10 GB limit
Postgres version compatibility (Postgres 14 to 17)
Extension compatibility
Region availability
Import Your Data
Once checks pass, we'll:
Create a new branch for your imported data.
Copy your data automatically using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
.
Verify that the import completed successfully.
note
During import, your source database remains untouched — we only read from it to create a copy in Neon.
Known Limitations
Currently limited to databases
smaller than 10GB
. We are actively working on supporting bigger workloads. In the meantime, conctact support if you are looking to migrate bigger databases.
The feature is supported in
AWS regions
only.
Databases that use
event triggers are not supported
.
Supabase and Heroku databases are not supported, as both use proprietary event triggers.
Databases running on
IPv6 are not supported yet
.
AWS RDS is generally supported, though some incompatibilities may exist. Support for other providers may vary.
Next Steps
After a successful import:
Find your newly imported database branch on the
Branches
page of your project.
Imported branches are typically named with a timestamp, as shown here.
Run some test queries to ensure everything imported correctly.
Click on the three dots next to the branch name and select
Set as default
to make it your default branch.
Optional cleanup:
Delete the old branches (
production
and
development
) if they are no longer needed.
Rename the new branch to
production
for clarity and consistency.
Switch your connection string to point to your new Neon database.

Import data from CSV
This topic shows how to import data into a Neon database table from a CSV file using a simple example.
The instructions require a working installation of
psql
. The
psql
client is the native command-line client for Postgres. It provides an interactive session for sending commands to Postgres. For installation instructions, see
How to install psql
.
The following example uses the ready-to-use
neondb
database that is created with your Neon project, a table named
customer
, and a data file named
customer.csv
. Data is loaded from the
customer.csv
file into the
customer
table.
Connect to your database
Connect to the
neondb
database using
psql
. For example:
psql
"<your_neon_database_connection_string>"
You can find your connection string on your Neon Project Dashboard. Click on the
Connect
button. Use the drop-down menu to copy a full
psql
connection command.
note
For more information about connecting to Neon with
psql
, see
Connect with psql
.
Create the target table
Create the
customer
table — table you are importing to must exist in your database and the columns must match your CSV file.
CREATE
TABLE
customer
(
id
SERIAL
,
first_name
VARCHAR
(
50
),
last_name
VARCHAR
(
50
),
email
VARCHAR
(
255
),
PRIMARY KEY
(id)
)
tip
You can also create tables using the
SQL Editor
in the Neon Console. See
Query with Neon's SQL Editor
.
Prepare the CSV file
Prepare a
customer.csv
file with the following data — note that the columns in the CSV file match the columns in the table you created in the previous step.
First Name,Last Name,Email
1,Casey,Smith,casey.smith@example.com
2,Sally,Jones,sally.jones@example.com
Load the data
From your
psql
prompt, load the data from the
customer.csv
file using the
\copy
option.
\copy
customer
FROM
'/path/to/customer.csv'
DELIMITER
','
CSV
HEADER
If the command runs successfully, it returns the number of records copied to the database:
COPY
2
For more information about the
\copy
option, refer to the
psql reference
, in the
PostgreSQL Documentation

source database endpoint
in AWS DMS.
Set up a Neon project and a target database. See
Create a project
, and
Create a database
for instructions.
If you are migrating from a database other than Postgres, use the
Schema Conversion Tool
or
DMS Schema Conversion
to convert and export the schema from the source database to the target database. Perform this step after creating the target endpoint for the Neon database but before the data migration. If migrating from a Postgres database, schema conversion is not required.
Create a target endpoint for your Neon database
In the AWS Console, select
Database Migration Service
.
Select
Endpoints
from the sidebar.
Click
Create endpoint
.
Select
Target endpoint
as the
Endpoint type
.
Provide an
Endpoint identifier
label for your new target endpoint. In this guide, we use
neon
as the identifier.
In the
Target engine
drop-down menu, select
PostgreSQL
.
Under
Access to endpoint database
, select
Provide access information manually
and enter the information outlined below. You can obtain the connection details from your Neon connection string, which you can find by clicking the
Connect
button on your Neon
Project Dashboard
. Your connection string will look similar to this:
postgresql://daniel:AbC123dEf@ep-curly-term-54009904.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb"
.
Server name
: Specify your Neon hostname, which is this portion of your connection string:
ep-curly-term-54009904.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
Port
:
5432
User name
: Specify the Neon user.
Password
: Specify the password in the following format:
endpoint=[endpoint_id]$[password]
, which looks similar to this when defined:
endpoint=ep-curly-term-54009904$AbC123dEf
You can obtain the
endpoint_id
and password from your Neon connection string. The
endpoint_id
appears similar to this:
ep-curly-term-54009904
. For information about why this password format is required, see
Connection errors
. AWS DMS requires the
Option D workaround
.
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) mode
: Select
require
.
Database name
: The name of your Neon database. In this example, we use a database named
neondb
When finished, your target endpoint configuration should look similar to this:
Under
Test endpoint connection (optional)
, click
Run test
to test the connection. Running the test creates the endpoint and attempts to connect to it. If the connection fails, you can edit the endpoint definition and test the connection again.
Select
Create endpoint
.
Create a database migration task
A database migration task defines the data to be migrated from the source database to the target database.
In AWS DMS, select
Database migration tasks
from the sidebar.
Select
Create task
to open a
Create database migration task
page.
Enter a
Task identifier
to identify the replication task. In this example, we name the identifier
dms-task
.
Select the
Replication instance
. In this guide, the replication instance is named
dms_instance
.
Select the
Source database endpoint
. In this guide, the replication instance is named
dms_postgresql
.
Select the
Target database endpoint
. In this guide, the target database endpoint identifier is
neon
.
Select a
Migration type
. In this example, we use the default
Migrate existing data
type.
Task settings
Specify the following task settings:
For
Editing mode
, select
Wizard
.
For Target table preparation mode, select
Do nothing
. This option means that AWS DMS only creates tables in the target database if they do not exist.
For the
LOB column
setting, select
Don't include LOB columns
. Neon does not support LOB columns.
Optionally, under
Validation
, check
Turn on
to compare the data after the load operation finishes to ensure that data was migrated accurately. For more information about validation, refer to the
AWS data validation documentation
.
You can also check
Enable CloudWatch logs
and set
Target Load
to
Debug
or
Detailed debug
to log information during the migration process. This data is useful for troubleshooting migration issues.
Table mappings
Configure the table mapping:
For
Editing mode
, select
Wizard
.
Under
Selection rules
, click
Add new selection rule
.
For
Schema
, select
Enter a schema
.
For
Source name
, enter the name of your database schema. In this guide,
dms_sample
is specified as the schema name, which is the schema for the sample database. The
dms_sample
schema will be created in your Neon database, and all database objects will be created in the schema.
For the
Source table name
, leave the
%
wildcard character to load all tables in the schema.
For
Action
, select
Include
to migrate the objects specified by your selection rule.
Migration task startup configuration
Under
*Migration task startup configuration
, select
Automatically on create
.
Click
Start migration task
at the bottom of the page. The data migration task is created, and the data migration operation is initiated. You can monitor operation progress on the AWS DMS
Database migrations tasks
page.
Verify the migration in Neon
To verify that data was migrated to your Neon database:
In the Neon Console, select your Neon project.
Select
Tables
from the side bar.
Select the
Branch
,
Database
, and
Schema
where you imported the data.
.
Migration notes
This section contains notes from our experience using AWS DMS to migrate data to Neon from an RDS Postgres database.
When testing migration steps, the
Getting started with AWS Database Migration Service
tutorial was our primary reference. As recommended in the tutorial, we created a VPC and created all resources within the VPC.
We created all resources in the same region (
us-east-2a
)
We created an RDS PostgreSQL 15 database called
dms_sample
as the source database. The Neon target database was also Postgres 15.
We populated the RDS PostgreSQL source database using the
AWS DMS sample Postgres database
. To do this, we created an EC2 instance to connect to the database following the steps in this topic:
Create an Amazon EC2 Client
.
The source database was populated using this
psql
command:
psql
-h
dms-postgresql.abc123def456hgi.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com
-p
5432
-U
postgres
-d
dms_sample
-a
-f
~/aws-database-migration-samples/PostgreSQL/sampledb/v1/postgresql.sql
To verify that data was loaded in the source database, we connected using the following
psql
command and ran a
SELECT
query:
psql
\
--host=dms-postgresql.abc123def456hgi.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com \
--port=5432 \
--username=postgres \
--password \
--dbname=dms_sample
dms_sample
=>
SELECT
*
from
dms_sample.player
LIMIT
100
;
When creating the source database endpoint for the RDS Postgres 15 database, we set
Secure Socket Layer (SSL) mode
to
require
. Without this setting, we encountered the following error:
Test Endpoint failed: Application-Status: 1020912, Application-Message: Failed to connect Network error has occurred, Application-Detailed-Message: RetCode: SQL_ERROR SqlState: 08001 NativeError: 101 Message: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "10.0.1.135", user "postgres", database "dms_sample", no encryption
When creating the target database endpoint for the Neon database, we encountered the following error when testing the connection:
Endpoint failed: Application-Status: 1020912, Application-Message: Cannot connect to ODBC provider Network error has occurred, Application-Detailed-Message: RetCode: SQL_ERROR SqlState: 08001 NativeError: 101 Message: timeout expired
The replication instance, which was created in the private subnet where the source database resided, could not access the Neon database, which resides outside of the VPC. To allow the replication instance to access the Neon database, we added a NAT Gateway to the public subnet, allocated an Elastic IP address, and modified the
Route Table
associated with the private subnet to add a route via the NAT Gateway.

Migrate from Azure PostgreSQL to Neon
Learn how to migrate your database from Azure PostgreSQL to Neon using logical replication
This guide describes how to migrate your database from Azure Database for PostgreSQL to Neon, using logical replication.
Logical replication for Postgres transfers data from a source Postgres database to another, as a stream of tuples (records) or SQL statements. This allows for minimal downtime during the migration process, since all the records don't need to be copied at once.
Prerequisites
An Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance containing the data you want to migrate.
A Neon project to move the data to.
For detailed information on creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
. Make sure to create a project with the same Postgres version as your Azure PostgreSQL deployment.
Read the
important notices about logical replication in Neon
before you begin.
Review our
logical replication tips
, based on real-world customer data migration experiences.
Prepare your Azure PostgreSQL database
This section describes how to prepare your Azure PostgreSQL database (the publisher) for replicating data to your destination Neon database (the subscriber).
To illustrate the migration workflow, we set up the
AdventureWorks sample database
on an Azure Database for PostgreSQL deployment. This database contains data corresponding to a fictionaly bicycle parts company, organized across 5 schemas and almost 70 tables.
Enable logical replication in Azure PostgreSQL
Navigate to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL instance in the Azure portal.
From the left sidebar, select
Server parameters
under the
Settings
section.
Search for the
wal_level
parameter and set its value to
LOGICAL
.
Click
Save
to apply the changes.
note
Changing the
wal_level
parameter on Azure requires a server restart. This may cause a brief interruption to your database service.
Create a PostgreSQL role for replication
It is recommended that you create a dedicated Postgres role for replicating data. Connect to your Azure PostgreSQL database using a tool like
psql
or
Azure Data Studio
, then create a new role with
REPLICATION
privileges:
CREATE
ROLE
replication_user
WITH
REPLICATION
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'your_secure_password'
;
Grant schema access to your PostgreSQL role
Grant the necessary permissions to your replication role. For example, the following commands grant access to all tables in the
sales
schema to Postgres role
replication_user
:
GRANT
USAGE
ON
SCHEMA
sales
TO
replication_user;
GRANT
SELECT
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
sales
TO
replication_user;
ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
sales
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
replication_user;
Granting
SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA
instead of naming the specific tables avoids having to add privileges later if you add tables to your publication.
If you have data split across multiple schemas, you can run a similar command for each schema, or use a PL/pgSQL function to dynamically grant access to all schemas in the database.

END
;
$do$;
Create a publication on the source database
Publications are a fundamental part of logical replication in Postgres. They define what will be replicated. The following commands examples create publication named
azure_publication
with one or more tables.
To create a publication for a specific table:
CREATE
PUBLICATION azure_publication
FOR
<
tbl_name
>
;
To create a publication for multiple tables, provide a comma-separated list of tables:
CREATE
PUBLICATION azure_publication
FOR
TABLE
<
tbl1, tbl2, tbl3
>
;
note
Defining specific tables lets you add or remove tables from the publication later, which you cannot do when creating publications with
FOR ALL TABLES
.
For syntax details, see
CREATE PUBLICATION
, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
Allow inbound traffic from Neon
You need to allow inbound traffic from Neon Postgres servers so it can connect to your Azure database. To do this, follow these steps:
Log into the Azure portal and navigate to your Azure Postgres Server resource.
Click on the
Networking
option under the
Settings
section in the sidebar. Navigate to the
Firewall Rules
section under the
Public access
tab.
Click on
Add a Firewall Rule
, which generates a modal to add the range of IP addresses from which we want to allow connections. You will need to perform this step for each of the NAT gateway IP addresses associated with your Neon project's region. For each IP address, create a new rule and fill both the
Start IP
and
End IP
fields with the IP address.
Neon uses 3 to 6 IP addresses per region for this outbound communication, corresponding to each availability zone in the region. See
NAT Gateway IP addresses
for Neon's NAT gateway IP addresses.
To fetch the database schema using
pg_dump
, you also need to allow inbound traffic from your local machine (or where you are running
pg_dump
) so it can connect to your Azure database. Add another firewall rule entry with that IP address as the start and end IP address.
CLick
Save
at the bottom to make sure all changes are saved.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your destination Neon PostgreSQL database (the subscriber) to receive replicated data.
You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. See
Connect from any application
.
Create the Neon database
To keep parity with the Azure PostgreSQL deployment, create a new database with the same name. See
Create a database
for more information.
For this example, we run the following query to create a new database named
AdventureWorks
in the Neon project.
CREATE
DATABASE
"
AdventureWorks
";
Import the database schema
To ensure that the Neon
AdventureWorks
database has the same schema as the Azure PostgreSQL database, we'll need to import the schema. You can use the
pg_dump
utility to export the schema and then
psql
to import it into Neon.
Export the schema from Azure PostgreSQL:
pg_dump
--schema-only
--no-owner
--no-privileges
-h
<
azure-hos
t
>
-U
<
azure-use
r
>
-d
<
azure-databas
e
>
>
schema.sql
Import the schema into your Neon database:
psql
<
neon-connection-strin
g
>
<
schema.sql
Create a subscription
After importing the schema, create a subscription on the Neon database:
Use the
Neon SQL Editor
,
psql
, or another SQL client to connect to your Neon database.
Create the subscription using the
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
statement:
CREATE
SUBSCRIPTION neon_subscription
CONNECTION
'host=<azure-host> port=5432 dbname=<azure-database> user=replication_user password=your_secure_password'
PUBLICATION azure_publication;
Verify that the subscription was created by running the following query, and confirming that the subscription (
neon_subscription
) is listed:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
Monitor and verify the replication
To ensure that data is being replicated correctly:
Monitor the replication status on Neon, by running the following query:
SELECT
*
FROM
pg_stat_subscription;
This query should return an output similar to the following:
subid |      subname      | pid | leader_pid | relid | received_lsn |      last_msg_send_time       |     last_msg_receipt_time     | latest_end_lsn |        latest_end_time
-------+-------------------+-----+------------+-------+--------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+----------------+-------------------------------
24576 | neon_subscription | 540 |            |       | 1/3D0020A8   | 2024-09-11 11:34:24.841807+00 | 2024-09-11 11:34:24.869991+00 | 1/3D0020A8     | 2024-09-11 11:34:24.841807+00
(1 row)
An active
pid
indicates that the subscription is active and running.
The
received_lsn
and
latest_end_lsn
columns show the LSN (Log Sequence Number) of the last received (at Neon) and last written data (at Azure source), respectively.
In this example, they have the same value, which means that all the data has been successfully replicated from Azure to Neon.
To verify that the data has been replicated correctly, compare row counts between Azure PostgreSQL and Neon for some key tables. For example, you can run the following query to check the number of rows in the
addresses
table:
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
person.address;
It returns the same output on both databases:
count
-------
19614
(1 row)
Optionally, you can run some queries from your application against the Neon database to verify that it returns the same output as the Azure instance.
Complete the migration
Once the initial data sync is complete and you've verified that ongoing changes are being replicated:
Stop writes to your Azure PostgreSQL database.
Wait for any final transactions to be replicated to Neon.
Update your application's connection string to point to your Neon database.
This ensures a much shorter downtime for the application, as you only need to wait for the last few transactions to be replicated before switching the application over to the Neon database.
note
Remember to update any Azure-specific configurations or extensions in your application code to be compatible with Neon. For Neon Postgres parameter settings, see
Postgres parameter settings
. For Postgres extensions supported by Neon, see
Supported Postgres extensions
.
Clean up
After successfully migrating and verifying your data on Neon, you can:
Drop the subscription on the Neon database:
DROP
SUBSCRIPTION neon_subscription;
Remove the publication from the Azure PostgreSQL database:
DROP
PUBLICATION azure_publication;
Consider backing up your Azure PostgreSQL database before decommissioning it.
Other migration options
This section discusses migration options other than using logical replication.
pg_dump and pg_restore
If your database size is not large, you can use the
pg_dump
utility to create a dump file of your database, and then use
pg_restore
to restore the dump file to Neon. Please refer to the
Migrate from Postgres
guide for more information on this method.
Postgres GUI clients
Some Postgres clients offer backup and restore capabilities. These include
pgAdmin
and
phppgadmin
, among others. We have not tested migrations using these clients, but if you are uncomfortable using command-line utilities, they may provide an alternative.
Table-level data migration using CSV files
Table-level data migration (using CSV files, for example) does not preserve database schemas, constraints, indexes, types, or other database features. You will have to create these separately. Table-level migration is simple but could result in significant downtime depending on the size of your data and the number of tables. For instructions, see
Import data from CSV
.

Migrate from Digital Ocean Postgres to Neon
Learn how to migrate your Postgres database from Digital Ocean to Neon using pg_dump and pg_restore
This guide describes how to migrate a Postgres database from Digital Ocean to Neon using the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
utilities, which are part of the Postgres client toolset.
pg_dump
works by dumping both the schema and data in a custom format that is compressed and suitable for input into
pg_restore
to rebuild the database.
Prerequisites
A Digital Ocean Postgres database containing the data you want to migrate.
A Neon project to move the data to.
For detailed information on creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
. Make sure to create a project with the same Postgres version as your Digital Ocean deployment.
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
utilities installed on your local machine. These typically come with a Postgres installation.
We recommended that you use the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
programs from the latest version of Postgres, to take advantage of enhancements that might have been made in these programs. To check the version of
pg_dump
or
pg_restore
, use the
-V
option. For example:
pg_dump -V
.
Review our guide on
Importing data from Postgres
for more comprehensive information on using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
.
Prepare your Digital Ocean database
This section describes how to prepare your Digital Ocean database for exporting data.
To illustrate the migration workflow, we populate the Digital Ocean database with the
LEGO dataset
. This database contains information about LEGO sets, parts, and themes.
Retrieve Digital Ocean connection details
Log in to your Digital Ocean account and navigate to the Databases section.
Select your Postgres database.
In the
Connection Details
section under the
Overview
tab, you'll find the following information:
Host
Port
Database name
Username
Password (you may need to reset it if you don't have it)
You'll need these details to construct the connection string for
pg_dump
. Alternatively, you can toggle to the
Connection string
option to get the
postgresql://
connection string, which can be used directly with postgres CLI tools.
Export data with pg_dump
Now that you have the Digital Ocean connection details, you can export your data using
pg_dump
:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]
-f
digitalocean_dump.bak
Replace
[username]
,
[password]
,
[host]
,
[port]
, and
[database]
with your Digital Ocean connection details.
This command includes these arguments:
-Fc
: Outputs the dump in custom format, which is compressed and suitable for input into
pg_restore
.
-v
: Runs
pg_dump
in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor the dump operation.
-d
: Specifies the connection string for your Digital Ocean database.
-f
: Specifies the output file name.
If the command was successful, you'll see output similar to the following:
pg_dump:
saving
encoding
=
UTF8
pg_dump:
saving
standard_conforming_strings
=
on
pg_dump:
saving
search_path
=
pg_dump:

dumping
contents
of
table
"public.lego_sets"
pg_dump:

important
Avoid using
pg_dump
over a
pooled connection string
(see PgBouncer issues
452
&
976
for details). Use an
unpooled connection string
instead.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your destination Neon Postgres database to receive the imported data.
Create the Neon database
Each Neon project comes with a default database named
neondb
. To maintain consistency with your Digital Ocean setup, create a new database with the same name.
Connect to your Neon project using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a Postgres client like
psql
.
Create a new database. For example, if your Digital Ocean database was named
lego
, run:
CREATE
DATABASE
lego
;
For more information, see
Create a database
.
Retrieve Neon connection details
In the Neon Console, go to your
Project Dashboard
.
Click
Connect
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Copy the connection string. It will look similar to this:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Restore data to Neon with pg_restore
Now you can restore your data to the Neon database using
pg_restore
:
pg_restore
-d
<
neon-connection-strin
g
>
-v
--no-owner
--no-acl
digitalocean_dump.bak
Replace
<neon-connection-string>
with your Neon connection details.
This command includes these arguments:
-d
: Specifies the connection string for your Neon database.
-v
: Runs
pg_restore
in verbose mode.
--no-owner
: Skips setting the ownership of objects as in the original database.
--no-acl
: Skips restoring access privileges for objects as in the original database.
We recommend using the
--no-owner
and
--no-acl
options to skip restoring these settings, as they may not be compatible between Digital Ocean and Neon. After migrating the data, review and configure the appropriate roles and privileges for all objects, as needed.
If the command was successful, you'll see output similar to the following:
pg_restore:
connecting
to
database
for
restore
pg_restore:
creating
SCHEMA
"public"
pg_restore:
creating

...
Verify the migration
After the restore process completes, you should verify that your data has been successfully migrated:
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or
psql
.
Run some application queries to check your data. For example, if you're using the
LEGO
database, you can run the following:
SELECT
is_trans
AS
is_transparent,
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
lego_colors
GROUP BY
is_trans;
SELECT
*
FROM
lego_sets
ORDER BY
num_parts
DESC
LIMIT
5
;
Compare the results with those from running the same queries on your Digital Ocean database to ensure data integrity.
Clean up
After successfully migrating and verifying your data on Neon, you can update your application's connection strings to point to your new Neon database. We recommend that you keep your Digital Ocean database dump file (
digitalocean_dump.bak
) as a backup until you've verified that the migration was successful.
Other migration options
While this guide focuses on using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
, there are other migration options available:
Logical replication
For larger databases or scenarios where you need to minimize downtime, you might consider using logical replication. See our guide on
Logical replication
for more information.
CSV export/import
For smaller datasets or specific tables, you might consider exporting to CSV from Digital Ocean and then importing to Neon. See
Import data from CSV
for more details on this method.

Migrate from Firebase Firestore to Neon Postgres
Learn how to migrate your data from Firebase Firestore to Neon Postgres using a custom Python script
This guide describes how to migrate data from Firebase Firestore to Neon Postgres.
We'll use a custom Python script to export data from Firestore to a local file, and then import the data into Neon Postgres. This approach allows us to handle Firestore's document-based structure and convert it into the relational database format suitable for Postgres.
Prerequisites
A Firebase project containing the Firestore data you want to migrate.
A Neon project to move the data to.
For detailed information on creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Python 3.10 or later installed on your local machine. Additionally, add the following packages to your Python virtual environment:
firebase_admin
, which is Google's python SDK for Firebase and
psycopg
, which is used to connect to Neon Postgres database.
You can install them using
pip
:
pip
install
firebase-admin
"psycopg[binary,pool]"
Retrieve Firebase credentials
This section describes how to fetch the credentials to connect to your Firebase Firestore database.
Log in to your Firebase Console and navigate to your project.
Go to
Project settings
(the gear icon next to "Project Overview" in the left sidebar).
Under the
Service Accounts
tab, click
Generate new private key
. This will download a JSON file containing your credentials.
Save this JSON file securely on your local machine. We'll use it in our Python script.
For more information, please consult the
Firebase documentation
.
Export data from Firestore
In this step, we will use a Python script to export data from Firestore. This script will:
Connect to Firestore
Retrieve all collections and documents
Save the Firestore documents to a format suitable for ingesting into Postgres later
Here's the Python script:

()
Save this script as
firebase-download.py
. To run the script, you need to provide the path to your Firebase credentials JSON file and the output directory for the downloaded data. Run the following command in your terminal:
python
firebase-download.py
--credentials
path/to/your/firebase-credentials.json
--output
firestore_data
For each unique collection id, this script creates a line-delimited JSON file, and all documents in that collection (spanning different top-level documents) are saved to it. For example, if you have a collection with the following structure:
/users
/user1
/orders
/order1
/order2
/items
/item1
/item2
/user2
/orders
/order3
The script will create the following files:
users.json
: Contains all user documents, i.e.,
user1
,
user2
.
orders.json
: Contains all order documents across all users -
order1
,
order2
,
order3
.
items.json
: Contains all item documents across all orders -
item1
,
item2
.
Each file contains a JSON object for each document. To illustrate,
order1
gets saved to
orders.json
in the following format:
{
"id"
:
"users/user1/orders/order1"
,
"parent_id"
:
"users/user1"
,
"data"
:
{
"order_date"
:
"2023-06-15"
,
"total_amount"
:
99.99
}
}
This structure allows for easy reconstruction of the hierarchical relationships between users, orders, and items, while also providing a flat file structure that's easy to process and import into other systems.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your destination Neon Postgres database to receive the imported data.
Create the Neon database
In the Neon Console, go to your project dashboard.
In the sidebar, click on
Databases
.
Click the
New Database
button.
Enter a name for your database and click
Create
.
For more information, see
Create a database
.
Retrieve Neon connection details
In the Neon Console, go to your project dashboard.
Click
Connect
to open the
Connect to your database
modal, and select your database.
Copy the connection string. It will look similar to this:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]

Save this script as
neon-import.py
. To run the script, you need to provide the path to the input directory containing the JSON files and the Neon connection string. Run the following command in your terminal:
python
neon-import.py
--input
firestore_data
--postgres
"<neon-connection-string>"
This script iterates over each JSON file in the input directory, creates a table in the Neon database for each collection, and inserts the data into the table. It also handles conflicts by updating the existing data with the new data.
Verify the migration
After running both the Firestore export and the Neon import scripts, you should verify that your data has been successfully migrated:
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or
psql
.
List all tables in your database:
\dt
Run some sample queries to check that the data has been successfully imported. For example, the following query fetches all orders made by the first two customers:
SELECT
data
FROM
orders
WHERE
parent_id
IN
(
SELECT
id
FROM
customers
LIMIT
2
)
Compare the results with those from your Firestore database to ensure data integrity. Note that using the
parent_id
field, we can navigate through the hierarchical structure of the original data.
Other migration options
While this guide focuses on using a custom Python script, there are other migration options available:
Firestore managed export/import
If you have a large volume of data to migrate, you can use the
Google Cloud Firestore managed export and import service
. It allows you to export your Firestore data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, from where you can download and ingest it into Neon.
Open source utilities
There are also a number of open source utilities available that can help export data from Firestore to local files.
firestore-import-export
firestore-backup-restore
However, these utilities are not as robust as the managed export/import service. If your data size is not big, we recommend using the sample code provided above or adapting it to your specific needs.

ap
p
>
where
<app>
is the Heroku App Name.
For example:
$
heroku
pg:links
--app
thawing-wave-57227
===
postgresql-trapezoidal-48645
Import your data
From your terminal, run the following Heroku CLI command:
heroku
pg:pull
--app
[app] [heroku-pg-database] [neon-connection-string]
where:
[app]
is the name of the Heroku app
[heroku-pg-database]
is the name of the Heroku PostgreSQL database
[neon-connection-string]
is the Neon connection string
For example:
$
heroku
pg:pull
--app
thawing-wave-57227

Migrate data from another Neon project
This guide describes how to migrate a database from one Neon project to another by piping data from
pg_dump
to
pg_restore
.
important
Avoid using
pg_dump
over a
pooled connection string
(see PgBouncer issues
452
&
976
for details). Use an
unpooled connection string
instead.
Use these instructions to:
Import a database from a Neon project created in one region to a project created in another region.
Import a database from a Neon project created with one Postgres version to a Neon project created with another Postgres version.
tip
You can also use these alternative methods to migrate data between Neon projects:
Import Data Assistant
: A fast and simple option for databases under 10 GB. See
Import Data Assistant
.
Logical replication
: Move your data from one Neon project to another. Consider this option for large databases requiring near-zero downtime. See
Replicate data from one Neon project to another
.
Important considerations
Upgrading the Postgres version
: When upgrading to a new version of Postgres, always test thoroughly before migrating your production systems or applications. We also recommend familiarizing yourself with the changes in the new version of Postgres, especially those affecting compatibility. For information about those changes, please refer to the official Postgres
Release 15
or
Release 16
documentation.
Piping considerations
: Piping is not recommended for large datasets, as it is susceptible to failures during lengthy migration operations (see
Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore
for more information). If your dataset is large, we recommend performing the dump and restore as separate operations. For instructions, see
Migrate data from Postgres with pg_dump and pg_restore
.
Import data from another project
To import your data from another Neon project:
Create a new project with the desired region or Postgres version. See
Create a project
for instructions.
Create a database with the desired name in your new Neon project. See
Create a database
for instructions.
Retrieve the connection strings for the new and existing Neon databases.
You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Connections strings have this format:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Prepare your command to pipe data from one Neon project to the other. For the
pg_dump
command, specify connection details for the source database. For the
pg_restore
command, specify connection details for the destination database. The command should have the following format:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[source_neon_hostname]/[dbname]
|
pg_restore
-v
-d
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[destination_neon_hostname]/[dbname]
With actual source and destination connection details, your command will appear similar to this:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/my_source_db
|
pg_restore
-v
-d

Migrate data from Postgres with pg_dump and pg_restore
This topic describes migrating data from one Postgres database to another using the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
.
important
Avoid using
pg_dump
over a
pooled connection string
(see PgBouncer issues
452
&
976
for details). Use an
unpooled connection string
instead.
Repeat the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
process for each database you want to migrate.
If you are performing this procedure to migrate data from one Neon project to another to upgrade to a new Postgres version, read
Upgrading your Postgres version
first.
Before you begin
We recommended that you use the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
programs from the latest version of Postgres, to take advantage of enhancements that might have been made in these programs. To check the version of
pg_dump
or
pg_restore
, use the
-V
option. For example:
pg_dump -V
.
Neon supports PostgreSQL 14, 15, 16, and 17. We recommend that clients are the same version as source Postgres instance.
Retrieve the connection parameters or connection string for your source Postgres database. This could be a Neon Postgres database or another Postgres database. The instructions below use a
connection string
, but you can use the connection format you prefer. If you are logged in to a local Postgres instance, you may only need to provide the database name. Refer to the
pg_dump
documentation for information about connection parameters.
Optionally, create a role in Neon to perform the restore operation. The role that performs the restore operation becomes the owner of restored database objects. For example, if you want role
sally
to own database objects, create
role
sally in Neon and perform the restore operation as
sally
.
If you have assigned database object ownership to different roles in your source database, read
Database object ownership considerations
. You may want to add the
-O, --no-owner
option to your
pg_restore
command to avoid errors.
Create the target database in Neon. For example, if you are migrating a database named
pagila
, create a database named
pagila
in Neon. For instructions, see
Create a database
.
Retrieve the connection string for the target Neon database. You can find the connection string by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It will look something like this:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Consider running a test migration first to ensure your actual migration goes smoothly. See
Run a test migration
.
If your database is small, you can pipe
pg_dump
output directly to
pg_restore
to save time. See
Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore
.
Export data with pg_dump
Export your data from the source database with
pg_dump
:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
<
source_database_connection_strin
g
>
-f
<
dump_file_nam
e
>
The
pg_dump
command above includes these arguments:
-Fc
: Sends the output to a custom-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore
.
-v
: Runs
pg_dump
in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the dump operation.
-d
: Specifies the source database name or
connection string
.
-f
: The dump file name. It can be any name you choose (
mydumpfile.bak
, for example).
For more command options, see
Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options
.
Restore data to Neon with pg_restore
Restore your data to the target database in Neon with
pg_restore
.
note
If you assigned database object ownership to different roles in your source database, consider adding the
-O, --no-owner
option to your
pg_restore
command to avoid errors. See
Database object ownership considerations
.
pg_restore
-v
-d
<
neon_database_connection_strin
g
>
<
dump_file_nam
e
>
The example above includes these arguments:
-v
: Runs
pg_restore
in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the restore operation.
-d
: Specifies the Neon database to connect to. The value is a Neon database connection string. See
Before you begin
.
<dump_file_name>
is the name of the dump file you created with
pg_dump
.
For more command options, see
Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options
.
pg_dump and pg_restore example
The following example shows how data from a
pagila
source database is dumped and restored to a
pagila
database in Neon using the commands described in the previous sections. (A database named
pagila
was created in Neon prior to running the restore operation.)
~
$ cd mydump
~
/mydump$ pg_dump -Fc -v -d postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila -f mydumpfile.bak
~
/mydump$ ls
mydumpfile.bak
~
/mydump$ pg_restore -v -d postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila mydumpfile.bak
Pipe pg_dump to pg_restore
For small databases where the source and target Postgres instances and databases are presumed to be compatible, the standard output of
pg_dump
can be piped directly into a
pg_restore
command to minimize migration downtime:
pg_dump
[args]
|
pg_restore
[args]
For example:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
<
source_database_connection_strin
g
>
|
pg_restore
-v
-d
<
neon-database-connection-strin
g
>
Piping is not recommended for large databases because it can fail during lengthy migration operations. Incompatibilities between the source and target Postgres instances or databases may also cause a piping operation to fail. If you're importing from another Postgres instance, review Neon's
compatibility
page to ensure that Neon Postgres is compatible with your source Postgres instance. If you're unsure or encounter issues, consider using separate dump and restore operations. This approach lets you adjust dump and restore options or modify the dump file directly to resolve migration challenges.
When piping
pg_dump
output directly to
pg_restore
, the custom output format (
-Fc
) is most efficient. The directory format (
-Fd
) format cannot be piped to
pg_restore
.
Post-migration steps
After migrating your data, update your applications to connect to your new database in Neon. You will need the database connection string that you used in your
pg_restore
command. If you run into any problems, see
Connect from any application
. After connecting your applications, test them thoroughly to ensure they function correctly with your new database.
Database object ownership considerations
Roles created in the Neon Console, including the default role created with your Neon project, are automatically granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role. This role can create roles and databases, select from all tables and views, and insert, update, or delete data in all tables. However, the
neon_superuser
is not a PostgreSQL
superuser
. It cannot run
ALTER OWNER
statements to grant ownership of database objects. As a result, if you granted ownership of database objects in your source database to different roles, your dump file will contain
ALTER OWNER
statements, and those statements will cause non-fatal errors when you restore data to your Neon database.
note
Regardless of
ALTER OWNER
statement errors, a restore operation still succeeds because assigning ownership is not necessary for the data itself to be restored. The restore operation will still create tables, import data, and create other objects.
To avoid the non-fatal errors, you can ignore database object ownership statements when restoring data by specifying the
-O, --no-owner
option in your
pg_restore
command:
pg_restore
-v
-O
-d
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/pagila
mydumpfile.bak
The Neon role performing the restore operation becomes the owner of all database objects.
Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options
The
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
commands provide numerous advanced options, some of which are described below. Full descriptions and more options are found in the PostgreSQL
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
documentation.
pg_dump options
-Z
: Defines the compression level to use when using a compressible format. 0 means no compression, while 9 means maximum compression. In general, we recommend a setting of 1. A higher compression level slows the dump and restore process but also uses less disk space.
--lock-wait-timeout=20s
: Error out early in the dump process instead of waiting for an unknown amount of time if there is lock contention.
Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump. Instead fail if unable to lock a table within the specified timeout.`
-j <njobs>
: Consider this option for large databases to dump tables in parallel. Set
<njobs>
to the number of available CPUs. Refer to the
pg_dump
documentation for more information. In Neon, this option only make sense for Neon paid plan users who can configure computes with >1 vCPU.
--no-blobs
: Excludes large objects from your dump. See
Data migration notes
.
pg_restore options
-c --if-exists
: Drop database objects before creating them if they already exist. If you had a failed migration, you can use these options to drop objects created by the previous migration to avoid errors when retrying the migration.
-j <njobs>
: Consider this option for large databases to run the restore process in parallel. Set
<njobs>
to the number of available vCPUs. Refer to the
pg_dump
documentation for more information. In Neon, this option only makes sense for Neon paid plan users who can configure computes with >1 vCPU. It cannot be used together with
--single-transaction
.
--single-transaction
: Forces the operation to run as an atomic transaction, which ensures that no data is left behind when a restore operation fails. Retrying an import operation after a failed attempt that leaves data behind may result in "duplicate key value" errors.
--no-tablespaces
: Do not output commands to select tablespaces. See
Data migration notes
.
-t <table_name>
: Allows you to restore individual tables from a custom-format database dump. Individual tables can also be imported from a CSV file. See
Import from CSV
.
Run a test migration
It is recommended that you run a test migration before migrating your production database. Make sure you can successfully migrate data to the new database and connect to it. Before starting the actual migration, create a database dump and address any issues that show up. In Neon, you can quickly create a test database, obtain the connection string, and delete the database when you are finished with it. See
Create a database
.
Other migration options
This section discusses migration options other than
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
.
Postgres GUI clients
Some Postgres clients offer backup and restore capabilities. These include
pgAdmin
and
phppgadmin
, among others. We have not tested migrations using these clients, but if you are uncomfortable using command-line utilities, they may provide an alternative.
Table-level data migration
Table-level data migration (using CSV files, for example) does not preserve database schemas, constraints, indexes, types, or other database features. You will have to create these separately. Table-level migration is simple but could result in significant downtime depending on the size of your data and the number of tables. For instructions, see
Import data from CSV
.
Data migration notes
You can load data using the
psql
utility, but it only supports plain-text SQL dumps, which you should only consider for small datasets or specific use cases. To create a plain-text SQL dump with
pg_dump
utility, leave out the
-F
format option. Plain-text SQL is the default
pg_dump
output format.
pg_dumpall
is not supported.
pg_dump
with the
-C, --create
option is not supported.
Some PostgreSQL features, such as tablespaces and large objects, which require access to the local file system are not supported by Neon. To exclude selecting tablespaces, specify the
--no-tablespaces
option with
pg_restore
. To exclude large objects, specify the
--no-blobs
option with
pg_dump
.

Migrate from Render to Neon Postgres
Learn how to migrate your database from Render to Neon Postgres using pg_dump and pg_restore
This guide describes how to migrate a database from Render to Neon Postgres.
We use the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
utilities, which are part of the Postgres client toolset.
pg_dump
works by dumping both the schema and data in a custom format that is compressed and suitable for input into
pg_restore
to rebuild the database.
Prerequisites
A Render project containing the Postgres database you want to migrate.
A Neon project to move the data to.
For detailed information on creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
. Make sure to create a project with the same Postgres version as your Render deployment.
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
utilities installed on your local machine. These typically come with a Postgres installation.
We recommended that you use the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
programs from the latest version of Postgres, to take advantage of enhancements that might have been made in these programs. To check the version of
pg_dump
or
pg_restore
, use the
-V
option. For example:
pg_dump -V
.
Review our guide on
Migrating data from Postgres
for more comprehensive information on using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
.
Prepare your Render database
This section describes how to prepare your Render database for exporting data.
To illustrate the migration workflow, we use the
LEGO Database
. This database contains information about LEGO sets, parts, and themes. We load the LEGO database into Render using the
psql
command-line tool.
Retrieve Render connection details
Log in to your Render account and navigate to your project dashboard.
From the overview page, select the service (of the type
PostgreSQL
) corresponding to your database.
From the left sidebar, click on
Info
and under the
Connections
section, you'll find the connection parameters in different formats.
Copy the value for the
External Database URL
field.
You'll need this connection string for
pg_dump
to connect to the Render database.
Export data with pg_dump
Now that you have your Render connection details, you can export your data using
pg_dump
:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
<
render_external_database_ur
l
>
--schema=public
-f
render_dump.bak
Replace
<render_external_database_url>
with your Render External Database URL.
This command includes these arguments:
-Fc
: Outputs the dump in custom format, which is compressed and suitable for input into
pg_restore
.
-v
: Runs
pg_dump
in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor the dump operation.
-d
: Specifies the connection string for your Render database.
-f
: Specifies the output file name.
--schema=public
: Specifies the schema to dump. In this case, we only want to back up tables in the
public
schema.
If the command was successful, you'll see output similar to the following:
...
pg_dump:
saving
encoding
=
UTF8
pg_dump:
saving
standard_conforming_strings
=

important
Avoid using
pg_dump
over a
pooled connection string
(see PgBouncer issues
452
&
976
for details). Use an
unpooled connection string
instead.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your destination Neon Postgres database to receive the imported data.
Create the Neon database
To maintain consistency with your Render setup, you might want to create a new database in Neon with the same database name used in Render.
Connect to your Neon project using the
Neon SQL Editor
or a Postgres client like
psql
.
Create a new database. For example, if your Render database was named
lego
, run:
CREATE
DATABASE
lego
;
For more information, see
Create a database
.
Retrieve Neon connection details
In the Neon Console, go to your
Project Dashboard
.
Select
Connect
to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Copy the connection string. It will look similar to this:
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
Restore data to Neon with pg_restore
Now you can restore your data to the Neon database using
pg_restore
:
pg_restore
-d
<
neon-connection-strin
g
>
-v
--no-owner
--no-acl
render_dump.bak
Replace
<neon-connection-string>
with your Neon connection string.
This command includes these arguments:
-d
: Specifies the connection string for your Neon database.
-v
: Runs
pg_restore
in verbose mode.
--no-owner
: Skips setting the ownership of objects as in the original database.
--no-acl
: Skips restoring access privileges for objects as in the original database.
We recommend using the
--no-owner
and
--no-acl
options to skip restoring ownership and access control settings from Render. After migrating the data, review and configure the appropriate roles and privileges for all objects, as needed. For more information, refer to the section on
Database object ownership considerations
.
If the command was successful, you'll see output similar to the following:
pg_restore:
connecting
to
database
for
restore
pg_restore:
creating
SCHEMA
"public"
pg_restore:
creating
TABLE
"public.lego_colors"
pg_restore:

"public.lego_colors_id_seq"
pg_restore:

"public.lego_colors_id_seq"
pg_restore:
creating
TABLE
"public.lego_inventories"
pg_restore:
creating
SEQUENCE
"public.lego_inventories_id_seq"
...
Verify the migration
After the restore process completes, you should verify that your data has been successfully migrated:
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or
psql
.
Run some application queries to check your data. For example, if you're using the LEGO database, you can run the following:
SELECT
*
FROM
lego_inventory_parts
ORDER BY
quantity
DESC
LIMIT
5
;
SELECT
parent_id,
COUNT
(
name
)
FROM
lego_themes
GROUP BY
parent_id;
Compare the results with those from running the same queries on your Render database to ensure data integrity.
Clean up
After successfully migrating and verifying your data on Neon, you can update your application's connection strings to point to your new Neon database. We recommend that you keep your Render database dump file (
render_dump.bak
) as a backup until you've verified that the migration was successful.
Other migration options
While this guide focuses on using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
, there are other migration options available:
Logical replication
For larger databases or scenarios where you need to minimize downtime, you might consider using logical replication. See our guide on
Logical replication
for more information.
CSV export/import
For smaller datasets or specific tables, you might consider exporting to CSV from Render and then importing to Neon. See
Import data from CSV
for more details on this method.

.
Create a new database. For example, if your Supabase database was named
lego
, run:
CREATE

lego
;
For more information, see
Create a database
.
Retrieve Neon connection details
In the Neon Console, go to your project dashboard.

Restore data to Neon with pg_restore
Now you can restore your data to the Neon database using
pg_restore
:
pg_restore
-d
<
neon-connection-strin
g
>
-v
--no-owner
--no-acl
supabase_dump.bak
Replace
[user]
,
[password]
,
[neon_hostname]
, and
[dbname]
with your Neon connection details.
This command includes these arguments:
-d
: Specifies the connection string for your Neon database.
-v
: Runs
pg_restore
in verbose mode.
--no-owner
: Skips setting the ownership of objects as in the original database.
--no-acl
: Skips restoring access privileges for objects as in the original database.
A Supabase database has ownership and access control tied to the authentication system. We recommend that you use the
--no-owner
and
--no-acl
options to skip restoring these settings. After migrating the data, review and configure the appropriate roles and privileges for all objects, as needed. For more information, refer to the section on
Database object ownership considerations
.
If the command was successful, you’ll see output similar to the following:
pg_restore:

...
Verify the migration
After the restore process completes, you should verify that your data has been successfully migrated:
Connect to your Neon database using the
Neon SQL Editor
or
psql
.
Run some application queries to check your data. For example, if you're using the LEGO database, you can run the following:
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
lego_sets;
SELECT
*
FROM
lego_themes
LIMIT
5
;
Compare the results with those from running the same queries on your Supabase database to ensure data integrity.
Clean up
After successfully migrating and verifying your data on Neon, you can update your application's connection strings to point to your new Neon database. We recommend that you keep your Supabase dump file (
supabase_dump.bak
) as a backup until you've verified that the migration was successful.
Other migration options
While this guide focuses on using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
, there are other migration options available:
Logical replication
For larger databases or scenarios where you need to minimize downtime, you might consider using logical replication. See our guide on
Logical replication
for more information.
CSV export/import
For smaller datasets or specific tables, you might consider exporting to CSV from Supabase and then importing to Neon. See
Import data from CSV
for more details on this method.

Migrate from Microsoft SQL Server to Neon Postgres
Learn how to migrate a Microsoft SQL Server database to Neon Postgres using pgloader
This guide describes how to migrate your database from a Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL) database to Neon Postgres using
pgloader
.
The
pgloader
utility transforms data to a Postgres-compatible format as it reads from your MSSQL database. It uses the Postgres
COPY
protocol to stream the data into your Postgres database.
Prerequisites
An MSSQL instance containing the data you want to migrate.
For this guide, we use
Azure SQL
, which is a managed cloud-based offering of Microsoft SQL server. We set up an Azure SQL Database and populate it with the
Northwind sample dataset
. This dataset contains sales data corresponding to a fictional company that imports and exports food products, organized across multiple tables.
A Neon project to move the data to.
For detailed information on creating a Neon project, see
Create a project
.
Neon's Free Plan supports 500 MiB of data. If your data size is more than 500 MiB, you'll need to upgrade to one of Neon's paid plans. See
Neon plans
for more information.
Review the
Pgloader MSSQL to Postgres Guide
guide. It will provide you with a good understanding of
pgloader
capabilities and how to configure your
pgloader
configuration file, if necessary.
See
Pgloader configuration
for a
pgloader
configuration file update that may be required to connect to MSSQL from
pgloader
.
Prepare your MSSQL database
Retrieve Your MSSQL database credentials
Before starting the migration process, collect your MSSQL database credentials. If you are using Azure SQL, you can use the following steps to retrieve them:
Log into the Azure portal and navigate to your Azure SQL Database resource.
Navigate to the
Connection strings
tab under the
Settings
section and identify the connection string for your database. Make note of the following details:
Server
Database
User
Password (Not displayed in the Azure portal)
Keep the database connection details handy for later use.
Allow inbound traffic from Neon
If you are using Azure SQL, you need to allow inbound traffic from your local machine, so
pgloader
can connect to your database. To do this, follow these steps:
Log into the Azure portal and navigate to your Azure SQL Server resource.
Click on the
Networking
option under the
Settings
section in the sidebar. Navigate to the
Firewall Rules
section under the
Public access
tab.
Click on the
Add your Client IPv4 address
option, which will automatically create a new rule with the IP address of your local machine. If you are running
pgloader
elsewhere, replace both the
Start IP
and
End IP
fields with the IP address of that machine.
CLick
Save
at the bottom to make sure all changes are saved.
Prepare your Neon destination database
This section describes how to prepare your destination Neon PostgreSQL database to receive the migrated data.
Create the Neon database
To maintain parity with the MSSQL deployment, you might want to create a new database in Neon with the same name. Refer to the
Create a database
guide for more information.
For this example, we will create a new database named
Northwind
in the Neon project. Use
psql
to connect to your Neon project (alternatively, you can use the
Query editor
in the Neon console) and run the following query:
CREATE
DATABASE
"
Northwind
";
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Log in to the Neon Console. Find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Now, modify the connection string as follows to pass your
endpoint ID
(
ep-cool-darkness-123456
in this example) to Neon with your password using the
endpoint
keyword, as shown here:
postgresql://alex:endpoint
=ep-cool-darkness-123456
;
AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
note
Passing the
endpoint ID
with your password is a required workaround for some Postgres drivers, including the one used by
pgloader
. For more information about this workaround and why it's required, refer to our
connection workaround
documentation.
Keep your Neon connection string handy for later use.
Install pgloader
Here's how you can set up
pgloader
for your database migration:
Install the
pgloader
utility using your preferred installation method. Debian (apt), RPM package, and Docker methods are supported, as well as Homebrew for macOS (
brew install pgloader
). If your macOS has an ARM processor, use the Homebrew installation method.
See
Installing pgloader
for Debian (apt), RPM package, and Docker installation instructions.
Create a
pgloader
configuration file (e.g.,
mssql_to_neon.load
). Use your MSSQL database credentials to define the connection string for your database source. Use the Neon database connection string as the destination.
Example configuration in
mssql_to_neon.load
:
LOAD
DATABASE
FROM
mssql://migration_user:password@host:port/AdventureWorks
INTO
postgresql://alex:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456
;
AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Make sure to replace the connection string values with your own MSSQL and Neon credentials.
Run the migration with pgloader
To initiate the migration process, run:
pgloader
mssql_to_neon.load
The command output will show the progress of the migration, including any errors encountered and the total time taken. For our sample dataset, the output looks similar to this:

(5 rows)
Compare the results with the same queries run on your MSSQL database to ensure data integrity.
Clean up
After successfully migrating and verifying your data on Neon:
Consider backing up your MSSQL database before decommissioning it.
Update your application code to make SQL queries using the Postgres dialect.
Update your application's connection strings to point to your new Neon database.
Other migration options
While this guide focuses on using
pgloader
, you might need more manual adjustments to ensure:
There are no unintended changes to the application behavior. For example, all MSSQL data types don't translate one-to-one to Postgres data types.
The application code is compatible with Neon Postgres.
For complex migrations or when you need more control over the migration process, you might consider developing a custom Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process using tools like Python with SQLAlchemy.
Pgloader configuration
Pgloader
automatically detects table schemas, indexes, and constraints, but depending on the input table schemas, you might need to specify manual overrides in the configuration file. Refer to the
Command clauses
section of the
pgloader
documentation for more information.
With Azure SQL database,
pgloader
often runs into connection errors. To solve them, you might need to manually specify the FreeTDS driver configuration (which
pgloader
uses to connect to MSSQL). Please refer to the related issues in the
PGLoader GitHub repository
for more information.
Below is the section required to make
pgloader
work, at the time of writing. Replace the values with your own Azure SQL database credentials.

Migrate from MySQL to Neon Postgres
This topic describes how to migrate your MySQL database to Neon Postgres using
pgloader
.
The
pgloader
utility transforms data to a Postgres-compatible format as it is read from your MySQL database. It uses the
COPY
Postgres protocol to stream the data into your Postgres database.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure that you have the following:
A Neon account and a project. See
Sign up
.
A properly named database. For example, if you are migrating a database named
sakila
, you might want to create a database of the same name in Neon. See
Create a database
for instructions.
Neon's Free Plan supports 500 MiB of data. If your data size is more than 500 MiB, you'll need to upgrade to one of Neon's paid plans. See
Neon plans
for more information.
Also, a close review of the
Pgloader MySQL to Postgres Guide
guide is recommended before you start. This guide will provide you with a good understanding of
pgloader
capabilities and how to configure your
pgloader
configuration file, if necessary.
Retrieve Your MySQL database credentials
Before starting the migration process, collect your MySQL database credentials:
Log into your MySQL database provider.
Identify and record the following details or grab your MySQL database connection string.
Hostname or IP address
Database name
Username
Password
Keep your MySQL database connection details handy for later use.
Retrieve your Neon database connection string
Log in to the Neon Console. Find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. It should look similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
Now, modify the connection string as follows to pass your
endpoint ID
(
ep-cool-darkness-123456
in this example) to Neon with your password using the
endpoint
keyword, as shown here:
postgresql://alex:endpoint
=ep-cool-darkness-123456
;
AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
note
Passing the
endpoint ID
with your password is a required workaround for some Postgres drivers, including the one used by
pgloader
. For more information about this workaround and why it's required, refer to our
connection workaround
documentation.
Keep your Neon connection string handy for later use.
Install pgloader
Here's how you can set up
pgloader
for your database migration:
Install the
pgloader
utility using your preferred installation method. Debian (apt), RPM package, and Docker methods are supported, as well as Homebrew for macOS (
brew install pgloader
). If your macOS has an ARM processor, use the Homebrew installation method.
See
Installing pgloader
for Debian (apt), RPM package, and Docker installation instructions.
Create a
pgloader
configuration file (e.g.,
config.load
). Use your MySQL database credentials to define the connection string for your database source. Use the Neon database connection string you retrieved and modified in the previous step as the destination.
note
If you need to specify an SSL mode in your connection string, the following format is recommended:
sslmode=require
. Other formats may not work.
Example configuration in
config.load
:
load
database
from
mysql://user:password@host/source_db?sslmode=require
into
postgresql://alex:endpoint=ep-cool-darkness-123456
;
AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode
=require
;
Run the migration with pgloader
To initiate the migration process, run:
pgloader
config.load

SSL verify error
If you encounter an
SSL verify error: 20 X509_V_ERR_UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY
error while attempting the instructions described above using
pgloader
from a Docker container, try the solution identified in this
GitHub issue
, which involves specifying
sslmode=allow
in the Postgres connection string and using the
--no-ssl-cert-verification
option with
pgloader
.
The following configuration file and Docker command were verified to work with Docker on Windows but may apply generally when using
pgloader
in a Docker container. In your
pgloader
config file, replace the MySQL and Postgres connection string values with your own. In the Docker command, specify the path to your
pgloader
config file, and replace the container ID value (the long alphanumeric string) with your own.

Migrate a database schema
Perform a schema-only migration with pg_dump and pg_restore
This topic shows how to perform a schema-only migration using the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
Postgres utilities.
A schema-only migration may be necessary in certain scenarios. For example, when replicating data between two Postgres instances, the tables defined in your publication on the source database must also exist in the destination database, and they must have the same table names and columns. A schema dump and reload in this case may be faster than trying to manually create the required schema on the destination database.
Dump the schema
To dump only the schema from a database, you can run a
pg_dump
command similar to the following to create an
.sql
dump file with the schema only:
pg_dump
--schema-only \
--no-privileges \
"postgresql://role:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
\
>
schema_dump.sql
With the
--schema-only
option, only object definitions are dumped. Data is excluded.
The
--no-privileges
option prevents dumping privileges. Neon may not support the privileges you've defined elsewhere, or if dumping a schema from Neon, there maybe Neon-specific privileges that cannot be restored to another database.
tip
When you're dumping or restoring on Neon, you can input your Neon connection string in place of
postgresql://role:password@hostname:5432/dbname
. You can find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
Review and modify the dumped schema
After dumping a schema to an
.sql
file, review it for statements that you don't want to replicate or that won't be supported on your destination database, and comment them out. For example, when dumping a schema from AlloyDB, you might see statements like the ones shown below, which you can comment out if you're loading the schema into Neon, where they won't be supported. Generally, you should remove any parameters configured on another Postgres provider and rely on Neon's default Postgres settings.
If you are replicating a large dataset, also consider removing any
CREATE INDEX
statements from the resulting dump file to avoid creating indexes when loading the schema on the destination database (the subscriber). Taking indexes out of the equation can substantially reduce the time required for initial data load performed when starting logical replication. Save the
CREATE INDEX
statements that you remove. You can add the indexes back after the initial data copy is completed.
note
To comment out a single line, you can use
--
at the beginning of the line.
-- SET statement_timeout = 0;
-- SET lock_timeout = 0;
-- SET idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = 0;
-- SET client_encoding = 'UTF8';
-- SET standard_conforming_strings = on;
-- SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);
-- SET check_function_bodies = false;
-- SET xmloption = content;
-- SET client_min_messages = warning;
-- SET row_security = off;
-- ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO alloydbsuperuser;
-- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS google_columnar_engine WITH SCHEMA public;
-- CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS google_db_advisor WITH SCHEMA public;
Load the schema
After making any necessary modifications, load the dumped schema using
pg_restore
:
psql \
"postgresql://role:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
\
<
schema_dump.sql
After you've loaded the schema, you can view the result with this
psql
command:
\dt

pgcopydb
is an open-source tool for copying Postgres databases from one server to another. It's a practical option for migrating larger Postgres databases into Neon.
Why use pgcopydb for data migration?
pgcopydb
builds on standard
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
but with extra features to make migrations both faster and more reliable:
Parallel migration
:
pgcopydb
processes multiple migration phases concurrently:
Data transfer:
Streams data in parallel from multiple tables and splits large tables into chunks. This distributes the load and reduces migration time for large datasets.
Index creation:
Builds indexes concurrently after data loading
Constraint application:
Applies constraints in parallel while maintaining data integrity
This parallel processing reduces migration time and minimizes downtime.
Dependency handling
:
pgcopydb
manages database object dependencies and migrates them in the correct order:
Schema-first approach:
Creates schema objects (tables, functions, procedures) before data transfer begins
Table copying precedes indexes and constraints:
Copies table data first, then creates indexes and applies constraints
This ordered approach maintains data integrity and avoids errors during migration.
This guide walks you through using
pgcopydb
to migrate data to Neon.
note
Logical replication with
pgcopydb clone --follow
is not supported on Neon. You can still use
pgcopydb
for a one-time data migration to Neon.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
Source postgres database
: You need access to the Postgres database you intend to migrate. This can be a local instance, a cloud-hosted database (AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, Azure Database for Postgres, or any other Postgres provider), or even a different Neon project.
Neon project
: You must have an active Neon project and a database ready to receive the migrated data. If you don't have a Neon project yet, see
Create a Neon project
to get started. Note that storage beyond your plan's included amount will incur additional charges.
pgcopydb installation
:
pgcopydb
must be installed on a machine that has network connectivity to both your source Postgres database and your Neon database. Check firewall rules and network configurations to allow traffic on the Postgres port. This machine should also have sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the migration workload. Install
pgcopydb
by following the instructions in the
pgcopydb documentation
.
Setup environment variables
Before proceeding, set the following environment variables for your source and target Postgres databases where you will run
pgcopydb
commands:
export
PGCOPYDB_SOURCE_PGURI
=
"postgresql://source_user:source_password@source_host:source_port/source_db"
export
PGCOPYDB_TARGET_PGURI
=
"postgresql://neon_user:neon_user_password@xxxx.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
You can replace the placeholders with your actual connection details. You can get Neon database connection details from the Neon console.
pgcopydb
will automatically use these environment variables for the migration.
Start data migration
Run the
pgcopydb clone
command with the
--no-owner
flag to skip ownership changes:
pgcopydb
clone
--no-owner
tip
When using
--no-owner
flag in
pgcopydb
, often pair it with
--no-acl
, especially if the source has custom ACLs or default privileges. This flag skips restoring permissions (
GRANT
/
REVOKE
,
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES
). This is crucial because the user connecting to the target database often lacks the high-level rights to reapply all source permissions. For example, even when migrating between Neon databases, the target user might get "permission denied" errors when trying to restore privileges involving administrative roles (like
cloud_admin
,
neon_superuser
), as they may lack permission to manage settings for those specific roles. This typically halts
pgcopydb
during the
pg_restore
phase. Using
--no-acl
avoids these specific permission errors and allows the migration to proceed smoothly. However, this means that any custom permissions set on the source database won't be replicated in the target database. You may need to manually set them up afterward.
Monitor the migration progress
You can monitor the migration progress using the
pgcopydb list progress
command. This command provides real-time updates on the migration status, including the number of rows copied and the current phase. You can either set the
--source
flag to your source database connection string or make use of the
PGCOPYDB_SOURCE_PGURI
environment variable.
pgcopydb
list
progress
--source
"your-source-connection-string"
--summary
After successful completion, you will see a summary of the migration steps and their durations, similar to the following:
Step   Connection    Duration    Transfer   Concurrency
--------------------------------------------------   ----------  ----------  ----------  ------------
Catalog Queries (table ordering, filtering, etc)       source       3s775                         1
Dump Schema       source       432ms                         1
Prepare Schema       target         26s                         1

Total Wall Clock Duration         both       1m17s                        20
Switch over your application to Neon
Switch your application to Neon and validate the migration after
pgcopydb clone
completes.
Stop writes to source database
: Halt write operations to your source database.
Validate migration
: Use
pgcopydb compare schema
and
pgcopydb compare data
for validation.
Update application connection string
: Point your application to your Neon database.
Advanced usage
pgcopydb
offers several advanced options to optimize and customize your migration. Here are some key considerations:
Boosting migration speed with parallelism
--table-jobs <integer>
&
--index-jobs <integer>
: These options control the number of concurrent jobs for copying tables and creating indexes, respectively. For large databases, increasing these values is crucial for reducing migration time.
Handling large tables efficiently
--split-tables-larger-than <bytes>
: Automatically splits tables exceeding the specified size into smaller chunks for parallel import, dramatically accelerating migration of large datasets. Start with
1GB
or
500MB
and adjust based on your table sizes.
Example:
pgcopydb
clone
--table-jobs
8
--index-jobs
12
--split-tables-larger-than
500MB
This command will run the migration with
8
concurrent table jobs,
12
concurrent index jobs, and split tables larger than
500
MB into smaller chunks for parallel import.
For more detail, see
Same-table Concurrency
in the
pgcopydb
docs.
Filtering and selective migration
--filters <filename>
: Sometimes you only need to migrate a subset of your database.
--filters
allows you to precisely control which tables, indexes, or schemas are included in the migration. This is useful for selective migrations or excluding unnecessary data. For filter configuration and examples, see the
pgcopydb filtering documentation

Neon architecture
Neon architecture is based on the separation of compute and storage and is orchestrated by the Neon Control Plane, which manages cloud resources across both storage and compute.
A Neon compute runs Postgres, and storage is a multi-tenant key-value store for Postgres pages that is custom-built for the cloud.
Neon storage consists of three main components: Safekeepers, Pageservers, and cloud object storage.
Safekeepers are responsible for durability of recent updates.
Postgres streams
Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
to the Safekeepers, and the Safekeepers store the WAL durably until it has been processed by the Pageservers and uploaded to a cloud object store.
Pageservers are responsible for serving read requests. To do that, Pageservers process the incoming WAL stream into a custom storage format that makes all
page
versions easily accessible. Pageservers also upload data to cloud object storage, and download the data on demand.
Safekeepers can be thought of as an ultra-reliable write buffer that holds the latest data until it is processed and uploaded to cloud storage. Safekeepers implement the Paxos protocol for reliability. Pageservers also function as a read cache for cloud storage, providing fast random access to data pages.
Durability
Durability is at the core of Neon's architecture. As described earlier, incoming WAL data is initially stored across multiple availability zones in a
Paxos
cluster before being uploaded to a cloud object store, such as
Amazon S3
(99.999999999% durability), both in raw WAL and materialized form. Additional copies are maintained across Pageservers to enhance the read performance of frequently accessed data. Consequently, there are always multiple copies of your data in Neon, ensuring durability.
Archive storage
Archive storage in Neon, which enables
branch archiving
on the Free Plan, optimizes storage resources by offloading data that's not being used. As described above, Neon’s architecture includes Safekeepers, Pageservers, and cloud object storage. In this setup, the Pageservers are responsible for processing and uploading data to cloud object storage as soon as it's written. When a branch is archived, it does not involve moving data; instead, the branch's data is simply evicted from the Pageserver, freeing up Pageserver storage. This approach ensures that while archived data is readily available on demand in cost-efficient object storage, it's no longer taking up space in the more performant storage used by Neon's Pageservers.

Scale to Zero
Minimize costs by automatically scaling inactive databases to zero
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature suspends the Neon compute that runs your Postgres database after a period of inactivity, which minimizes costs for databases that aren’t always active, such as development or test environment databases — and even production databases that aren't used 24/7.
When your database is inactive, it automatically scales to zero after 5 minutes. This means you pay only for active time instead of 24/7 compute usage. No manual intervention is required.
Once you query the database again, it reactivates automatically within a few hundred milliseconds.
The diagram below illustrates the
Scale to Zero
behavior alongside Neon's
Autoscaling
feature. The compute usage line highlights an
inactive
period, followed by a period where the compute is automatically suspended until it's accessed again.
Neon compute scales to zero after an
inactive
period of 5 minutes. For
Neon Free Plan
users, this setting is fixed. Paid plan users can disable the scale-to-zero setting to maintain an always-active compute.
You can enable or disable the scale-to-zero setting by editing your compute settings. For detailed instructions, see
Configuring scale to zero for Neon computes

Autoscaling architecture
Learn how Neon automatically scales compute resources on demand
What you will learn:
How Neon's autoscaling architecture is structured
The role of key components like the autoscaler-agent and Kubernetes scheduler
Related topics
Introduction to autoscaling
Enabling autoscaling
How the algorithm works
A Neon project can have one or more computes, each representing an individual Postgres instance. Storage is decoupled from these computes, meaning that the Postgres servers executing queries are physically separate from the data storage location. This separation offers numerous advantages, including enablement of Neon's autoscaling feature.
Looking more closely, you can see that each Postgres instance operates within its own virtual machine inside a
Kubernetes cluster
, with multiple VMs hosted on each node of the cluster. Autoscaling is implemented by allocating and deallocating
vCPU
and
RAM
to each VM.
The autoscaler-agent
Each
Kubernetes node
hosts a single instance of the
autoscaler-agent
, which serves as the control mechanism for Neon's autoscaling system. The agent collects metrics from the VMs on its node, makes scaling decisions, and performs the necessary checks and requests to implement those decisions.
The Kubernetes scheduler
A Neon-modified
Kubernetes scheduler
coordinates with the autoscaler-agent and is the single source of truth for resource allocation. The autoscaler-agent obtains approval for all upscaling from the scheduler. The scheduler maintains a global view of all resource usage changes and approves requests for additional resources from the autoscaler-agent or standard scheduling. In this way, the scheduler assumes responsibility for preventing overcommitting of memory resources. In the rare event that a node exhausts its resources, new pods are not scheduled on the node, and the autoscaler-agent is denied permission to allocate more resources.
NeonVM
Kubernetes does not natively support the creation or management of VMs. To address this, Neon uses a tool called
NeonVM
. This tool is a custom resource definition and controller for VMs, handling tasks such as adding or removing CPUs and memory. Internally, NeonVM utilizes
QEMU
and
KVM
(where available) to achieve near-native performance.
When an autoscaler-agent needs to modify a VM's resource allocation, it simply updates the corresponding NeonVM object in Kubernetes, and the VM controller then manages the rest of the process.
Live migration
In cases where a Kubernetes node becomes saturated, NeonVM manages the process of
live migrating
a VM, transferring the VM from one machine to another with minimal interruptions (typically around 100ms). Live migration transmits the internal state of the original VM to a new one while the former continues to operate, swiftly transitioning to the new VM after most of the data is copied. From within the VM, the only indication that a migration occurred might be a temporary performance reduction. Importantly, the VM retains its IP address, ensuring that connections are preserved and queries remain uninterrupted.
The live migration process allows for the proactive reduction of node load by migrating VMs away before reaching capacity. Although it is still possible for the node to fill up in the interim, Neon's separation of storage and compute means that VMs typically use minimal disk space, resulting in fast migrations.
Memory scaling
Postgres memory consumption can escalate rapidly in specific scenarios. Fortunately, Neon's autoscaling system is able to detect memory usage increases without constantly requesting metrics from the VM. This is accomplished by running Postgres within a
cgroups
, which provides notifications when memory usage crosses a specified threshold. Using cgroups in this way requires running our
vm-monitor
in the VM alongside Postgres to request more resources from the autoscaler-agent when Postgres consumes too much memory. The vm-monitor also verifies that downscaling requests from an autoscaler-agent will leave sufficient memory leftover.
Local File Cache
To expedite queries, the autoscaling system incorporates a Postgres extension that places a cache in front of the storage layer. Many queries benefit from this additional memory, particularly those requiring multiple database scans (such as creating an index). The
Local File Cache (LFC)
capitalizes on the additional memory allocated to the VM by dedicating a portion to the cache to itself. The cache is backed by disk and kept at a size intended to fit in the kernel page cache. Due to the storage model, writebacks are not required, resulting in near-instant evictions. The vm-monitor adjusts the LFC size when scaling occurs through the autoscaler-agent, ensuring seamless operation.

Autoscaling
An introduction to Neon's autoscaling
Neon's
Autoscaling
feature dynamically adjusts the amount of compute resources allocated to a Neon compute in response to the current load, eliminating the need for manual intervention or restarts.
The following visualization shows how Neon’s autoscaling works throughout a typical day. The compute resources scale up or down based on demand, ensuring that your database has the necessary compute resources when it needs them, while conserving resources during off-peak times.
To dive deeper into how Neon's autoscaling algorithm operates, visit
Understanding Neon’s autoscaling algorithm
.
Autoscaling benefits
Neon's Autoscaling feature offers the following benefits:
On-demand scaling:
Autoscaling helps with workloads that experience variations over time, such as applications with time-based changes in demand or occasional spikes.
Cost-effectiveness
: Autoscaling optimizes resource utilization, ensuring that you only use required resources, rather than over-provisioning to handle peak loads.
Resource and cost control
: Autoscaling operates within a user-defined range, ensuring that your compute resources and associated costs do not scale indefinitely.
No manual intervention or restarts
: After you enable autoscaling and set scaling limits, no manual intervention or restarts are required, allowing you to focus on your applications.
Configuring autoscaling
You can enable autoscaling for any compute instance, whether it's a primary compute or a read replica. Simply open the
Edit compute
drawer (
learn how
) for your compute and set the autoscaling range. This range defines the minimum and maximum compute sizes within which your compute will automatically scale. For example, you might set the minimum to 2 vCPUs with 8 GB of RAM and the maximum to 8 vCPUs with 32 GB of RAM. Your compute resources will dynamically adjust within these limits, never dropping below the minimum or exceeding the maximum, regardless of demand. We recommend regularly
monitoring
your usage from the
Monitoring Dashboard
to determine if adjustments to this range are needed.

Instant restore
Learn how to revert changes or recover lost data using Neon's instant restore with Time Travel Assist
What You'll Learn
Restore data to any point in time
Querying historical data
Related docs
Configure restore window
With Neon's instant restore capability, also known as point-in-time restore or PITR, you can easily restore a branch to an earlier state in its own or another branch's history. You can use Time Travel Assist to connect to a specific point in your restore window, where you can run read-only queries to pinpoint the exact moment you need to restore to. You can also use Schema Diff to get a side-by-side, GitHub-style visual comparison of your selected branches before restoring.
How instant restore works
Restore from history
The restore operation lets you revert the state of a selected branch to an earlier point in time in its own or another branch's history, using time and date or Log Sequence Number (LSN). For example, you can revert to a state just before a data loss occurred.
The default restore window for a Neon project differs by plan. You can revert a branch to any time within your configured
restore window
, down to the millisecond.
A few key points to keep in mind about the restore operation:
Restore backups are created automatically in case you make a mistake
Current data is overwritten
All databases on a branch are restored
Connections to the selected branch are temporarily interrupted
Automatic backups
In case you need to rollback a restore, Neon preserves the branch's final state before the restore operation in an automatically created backup branch, which takes the following format:
{
branch_name}_old_
{head_timestamp}
You can use this backup to rollback the restore operation if necessary. The backup branches are listed on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console among your other branches.
The backup becomes the parent of your original branch, which makes rolling back the restore operation simple:
Reset from parent
.
Overwrite, not a merge
It is important to understand that whenever you restore a branch, you are performing a
complete
overwrite, not a merge or refresh. Everything on your current branch, data and schema, is replaced with the contents from the historical source. All data changes from the selected restore point onwards are excluded from the branch.
Changes apply to all databases
A reminder that in Neon's
object hierarchy
, a branch can include any number of databases. Keep this in mind when restoring branches. For example, let's say you want to restore lost data in a given database. If you restore your branch to an earlier point in time before the data loss occurred, the operation applies to
all
databases on the branch, not just the one you are troubleshooting. You can expect the restore operation to last a few seconds.
In general, Neon recommends that you avoid creating too many databases in a single Neon project. If you have multiple, distinct applications, each one deserves its own Neon project. A good rule of thumb: use one Neon project per source code repository.
Connections temporarily interrupted
Existing connections to the selected branch are temporarily interrupted during the restore operation. However, your connection details do not change. Applications can automatically re-establish their database connections as soon as the restore operation is finished.
Technical details
Neon is open source and built in public, so if you are interested in understanding the technical implementation behind instant restore, see the details below.
View technical details
Similar to the manual restore operation using the Neon Console and API described
here
, the Restore operation performs a similar set of actions, but automatically:
On initiating a restore action, Neon builds a new point-in-time branch by matching your selected timestamp to the corresponding LSN of the relevant entries in the shared WAL record.
The compute for your initial branch is moved to this new branch so that your connection string remains stable.
We rename your new branch to the exact name as your initial branch, so the effect is seamless; it looks and acts like the same branch.
Your initial branch, which now has no compute attached to it, is renamed to
branch_name_old_head_timestamp
to keep the pre-restore branch available should you need to roll back. Note that the initial branch was the parent for your new branch, and this is reflected when you look at your branch details.
Time Travel Assist
Use Time Travel Assist to make sure you've targeted the correct restore point before you restore your branch.
See
Time Travel Assist
to learn more.
How to use instant restore
You can use the Neon Console, CLI, or API to restore branches.
Console
CLI
API
Restoring from history
Use the
Restore
page to restore a branch to an earlier timestamp in its history.
First, select the
Branch to restore
. This is the target branch for the restore operation.
To restore a branch from its own history:
Make sure the
From history
tab is selected.
Choose your timestamp or switch to LSN.
Click
Next
.
A confirmation window opens giving you details about the pending restore operation. Review these details to make sure you've made the correct selections.
Click
Restore
to complete the operation.
To restore from another branch:
Switch to the
From another branch
tab.
Select the source branch that you want to restore data from.
By default, the operation pulls the latest data from the source branch. If you want to pull from an earlier point in time, disable
Restore from latest data (head)
.
The timestamp selector will appear.
Choose your timestamp or switch to the LSN input.
Click
Next
, confirm the details of the operation, then click
Restore
to complete.
All databases on the selected branch are instantly updated with the data and schema from the chosen point in time. From the
Branches
page, you can now see a backup branch was created with the state of the branch at the restore point in time.
To make sure you choose the right restore point, we encourage you to use
Time Travel Assist
before running a restore job, but the backup branch is there if you need it.
If you do need to revert your changes, you can
Reset from parent
since that is your branch's relationship to the restore point backup.
Deleting backup branches
You can delete a backup branch created by a restore operation on your project's root branch. Your project's root branch is typically named
production
unless you've renamed it. However, removing a backup branch created by a restore operation on a non-root branch (a child branch of
production
) is not yet supported.
To delete a backup branch:
Navigate to the
Branches
page.
Find the backup branch you want to delete. It will have a name with the following format, where
branch_name
is typically
production
.
{
branch_name}_old_
{head_timestamp}
Select
Delete
from the menu.
If you cannot delete a backup branch because the backup branch was created by a restore operation on a non-root branch, you can still free up its storage space. If you're certain you no longer need the data in a backup branch, connect to the branch and drop its databases or tables.
Be sure to connect to the correct branch when doing this
. You can connect to a backup branch just like any other branch via the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client like
psql
.
To keep your
Branches
page organized, consider renaming backup branches that you plan to keep. For example, you can prefix their names with a
z
to move them to the bottom of the list. See
Rename a branch
for details.
Billing considerations
There are minimal impacts to billing from the instant restore and Time Travel Assist features:
Instant restore
— The backups created when you restore a branch do add to your total number of branches, but since they do not have a compute attached they do not add to consumption costs.
Time Travel Assist
— Costs related to Time Travel queries are minimal. See
Billing considerations
.
Limitations
Deleting backup branches is only supported for backups created by restore operations on root branches. See
Deleting backup branches
for details.
Reset from parent
restores from the parent branch, which may be a backup branch if you performed a restore operation on the parent branch.
For example, let's say you have a
production
branch with a child development branch
development
. You are working on
development
and decide to restore to an earlier point in time to fix something during development. At this point,
development
's parent switches from
production
to the backup
development_old_timestamp
. A day later, you want to refresh
development
with the latest data from
production
. You can't use
Reset from parent
, since the backup is now the parent. Instead, use
Instant restore
and select the original parent
production
as the source.

Branching
Branch your data the same way you branch your code
With Neon, you can quickly and cost-effectively branch your data for development, testing, and various other purposes, enabling you to improve developer productivity and optimize continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
You can also rewind your data or create branches from the past to recover from mistakes or analyze historical states.
What is a branch?
A branch is a copy-on-write clone of your data. You can create a branch from a current or past state. For example, you can create a branch that includes all data up to the current time or an earlier time.
working with sensitive data?
Neon also supports schema-only branching.
Learn more
.
A branch is isolated from its originating data, so you are free to play around with it, modify it, or delete it when it's no longer needed. Changes to a branch are independent. A branch and its parent can share the same data but diverge at the point of branch creation. Writes to a branch are saved as a delta.
Creating a branch does not increase load on the parent branch or affect it in any way, which means you can create a branch without impacting the performance of your production database.
Each Neon project is created with a
root branch
called
main
. The first branch that you create is branched from the project's root branch. Subsequent branches can be branched from the root branch or from a previously created branch.
Branching workflows
You can use Neon's branching feature in variety workflows.
Development
You can create a branch of your production database that developers are free to play with and modify. By default, branches are created with all of the data that existed in the parent branch, eliminating the setup time required to deploy and maintain a development database.
The following video demonstrates creating a branch in the Neon Console. For step-by-step instructions, see
Create a branch
.
You can integrate branching into your development workflows and toolchains using the Neon CLI, API, or GitHub Actions. If you use Vercel, you can use the Neon
Postgres Previews Integration
to create a branch for each preview deployment.
Refer to the following guides for instructions:

The Neon Postgres Previews Integration
Connect your Vercel project and create a branch for each preview deployment
Testing
Testers can create branches for testing schema changes, validating new queries, or testing potentially destructive queries before deploying them to production. A branch is isolated from its parent branch but has all of the parent branch's data up to the point of branch creation, which eliminates the effort involved in hydrating a database. Tests can also run on separate branches in parallel, with each branch having dedicated compute resources.
Refer to the following guide for instructions.
Branching — Testing queries
Instantly create a branch to test queries before running them in production
Restore and recover data
If you lose data due to an unintended deletion or some other event, you can restore a branch to any point in its restore window to recover lost data. You can also create a new restore branch for historical analysis or any other reason.
Restore window
Your
restore window
determines how far back Neon maintains a history of changes for each branch. By default, this is set to
1 day
to help you avoid unexpected storage costs. You can increase it up to:
24 hours on the
Free plan
7 days on
Launch
14 days on
Scale
30 days on
Business
You can configure your restore window in the Neon Console under
Settings
>
Storage
>
Instant restore
. See
Configure restore window
.
note
Increasing your restore window affects
all branches
in your project and increases
project storage
. You can reduce it to zero to minimize cost.
History is retained in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records. As WAL records age out of the retention period, they are evicted from storage and no longer count toward project storage.

Compute lifecycle
A compute in Neon is a stateless Postgres process due to the separation of storage and compute. It has two main states:
Idle
and
Active
.
Generally, an idle compute has been suspended by Neon's scale to zero feature due to inactivity, while an
Active
compute has been activated by a connection or operation, indicating that Postgres is currently running.
Scale to zero
If there are no active queries for 5 minutes, which is the scale to zero setting in Neon, your compute is automatically placed into an idle state. If you are on a paid plan, you can disable the scale to zero behavior so that a compute always remains active. This behavior is controlled by your compute's
Scale to zero
setting.
For information about configuring this setting, see
Edit a compute
.
note
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature is conservative. It treats an "idle-in-transaction" connection as active to avoid breaking application logic that involves long-running transactions. Only the truly inactive connections are closed after the defined period of inactivity.
Compute activation
When you connect to an idle compute, Neon automatically activates it. Activation generally takes a few hundred milliseconds. However, if your Neon project has been idle for more than 7 days, you may experience a slightly longer activation time.
Considering this activation time, your first connection may have a slightly higher latency than subsequent connections to an already-active compute. Also, Postgres memory buffers are cold after a compute wakes up from the idle state, which means that initial queries may take longer until the memory buffers are warmed.
After a period of time in the idle state, Neon occasionally activates your compute to check for data availability. The time between checks gradually increases if the compute does not receive any client connections over an extended period.
In the
Branches
widget on your
Project Dashboard
, you can check if a compute is active or idle and watch as it transitions from one state to another.
Session context considerations
When connections are closed due to a compute being suspended, anything that exists within a session context is forgotten and must be recreated before being used again. For example, Postgres parameters set for a specific session, in-memory statistics, temporary tables, prepared statements, advisory locks, and notifications and listeners defined using
NOTIFY/LISTEN
commands only exist for the duration of the current session and are lost when the session ends.
For more, see
Session context

Monitoring Neon with external tools
Monitor your Neon Postgres database with external tools such as PgAdmin or PgHero
There are external tools that you can use to monitor your Neon Postgres database, such as
PgHero
and
pgAdmin
. Setup instructions for those tools are provided below.
note
Neon does not currently support monitoring tools or platforms that require installing an agent on the Postgres host system, but please keep an eye on our
roadmap
for future integrations that enable these monitoring options.
PgHero
PgHero
is an open-source performance tool for Postgres that can help you find and fix data issues, using a dashboard interface.
A quick look at the interface gives you an idea of what you’ll find in PgHero.
Among other things, you can use PgHero to:
Identify long-running queries
Identify tables that require vacuuming
Identify duplicate or missing indexes
View connections by database and user
Explain, analyze, and visualize queries
How to install PgHero
PgHero supports installation with
Docker
,
Linux
, and
Rails
. Here, we’ll show how to install PgHero with Docker and connect it to a Neon database.
Before you begin:
Ensure that you have the
pg_stat_statements
extension installed. PgHero uses it for query stats. See above.
Ensure that you have Docker installed. See
Install Docker Engine
for instructions.
PgHero is available on
DockerHub
. To install it, run:
docker
pull
ankane/pghero
How to connect to your database from PgHero
Find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
.
Finally, run this command, replacing
$NEON_DB
with your Neon database connection string.
docker
run
-ti
-e
DATABASE_URL=
'$NEON_DB'
-p
8080:8080
ankane/pghero
Then visit
http://localhost:8080
in your browser to open the PgHero Dashboard.
pgAdmin
pgAdmin is a database management tool for Postgres designed to facilitate various database tasks, including monitoring performance metrics.
With pgAdmin, you can monitor real-time activity for a variety of metrics including:
Active sessions (Total, Active, and Idle)
Transactions per second (Transactions, Commits, Rollbacks)
Tuples in (Inserts, Updates, Deletes)
Tuples out (Fetched, Returned)
Block I/O for shared buffers (see
Cache your data
for information about Neon's Local File Cache)
Database activity (Sessions, Locks, Prepared Transactions)
Notes
Neon currently does not support the
system_stats
extension required to use the
System Statistics
tab in pgAdmin. It's also important to note that pgAdmin, while active, polls your database for statistics, which does not allow your compute to suspend as it normally would when there is no other database activity.
How to install pgAdmin
Pre-compiled and configured installation packages for pgAdmin 4 are available for different desktop environments. For installation instructions, refer to the
pgAdmin deployment documentation
. Downloads can be found on the
PgAdmin Downloads

If your compute was idle or there has not been much activity, graphs may display this message:
There is no data to display at the moment
. In this case, try selecting a different time period or returning later after more usage data has been collected.
All time values displayed in graphs are in
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
.
Endpoint Inactive: What does it mean?
The values and plotted lines in your graphs will drop to
0
when your compute is inactive because a compute must be active to report data. These inactive periods are also shown as a diagonal line pattern in the graph, as shown here:
RAM
This graph shows allocated RAM and usage over time for the selected compute.
ALLOCATED
: The amount of allocated RAM.
RAM is allocated according to the size of your compute or your
autoscaling
configuration, if applicable. For example, if your compute size is .25 CU (.25 vCPU with 1 GB RAM), your allocated RAM is always 1 (GB). With autoscaling, allocated RAM increases and decreases as your compute size scales up and down in response to load. If
scale to zero
is enabled and your compute transitions to an idle state after a period of inactivity, allocated RAM drops to 0.
Used
: The amount of RAM used.
The graph plots a line showing the amount of RAM used. If the line regularly reaches the maximum amount of allocated RAM, consider increasing your compute size to increase the amount of allocated RAM. To see the amount of RAM allocated for each Neon compute size, see
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
.
Cached
: The amount of data cached in memory.
CPU
This graph shows the amount of allocated CPU and usage over time for the selected compute.
ALLOCATED
: The amount of allocated CPU.
CPU is allocated according to the size of your compute or your
autoscaling
configuration, if applicable. For example, if your compute size is .25 CU (.25 vCPU with 1 GB RAM), your allocated CPU is always 0.25. With autoscaling, allocated CPU increases and decreases as your compute size scales up and down in response to load. If
scale to zero
is enabled and your compute transitions to an idle state after a period of inactivity, allocated CPU drops to 0.
Used
: The amount of CPU used, in
Compute Units (CU)
.
If the plotted line regularly reaches the maximum amount of allocated CPU, consider increasing your compute size. To see the compute sizes available with Neon, see
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
.
Connections count
The
Connections count
graph shows the number of idle connections, active connections, and the total number of connections over time for the selected compute.
ACTIVE
: The number of active connections for the selected compute.
Monitoring active connections can help you understand your database workload at any given time. If the number of active connections is consistently high, it might indicate that your database is under heavy load, which could lead to performance issues such as slow query response times. See
Connections
for related SQL queries.
IDLE
: The number of idle connections for the selected compute.
Idle connections are those that are open but not currently being used. While a few idle connections are generally harmless, a large number of idle connections can consume unnecessary resources, leaving less room for active connections and potentially affecting performance. Identifying and closing unnecessary idle connections can help free up resources. See
Find long-running or idle connections
.
TOTAL
: The sum of active and idle connections for the selected compute.
MAX
: The maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed for your compute size.
The MAX line helps you visualize how close you are to reaching your connection limit. When your TOTAL connections approach the MAX line, you may want to consider:

Database size
The
Database size

metric is only shown when there is more than one database on the selected branch.
important
Database size metrics are only displayed while your compute is active. When your compute is idle, database size values are not reported, and the
Database size
graph shows zero even though data may be present.
Deadlocks
The
Deadlocks
graph shows a count of deadlocks over time for the named database on the selected branch. The named database is always the oldest database on the selected branch.
Deadlocks occur in a database when two or more transactions simultaneously block each other by holding onto resources the other transactions need, creating a cycle of dependencies that prevent any of the transactions from proceeding, potentially leading to performance issues or application errors. For lock-related queries you can use to investigate deadlocks, see
Performance tuning
. To learn more about deadlocks in Postgres, see
Deadlocks
.
Rows
The
Rows
graph shows the number of rows deleted, updated, and inserted over time for the named database on the selected branch. The named database is always the oldest database on the selected branch. Row metrics are reset to zero whenever your compute restarts.
Tracking rows inserted, updated, and deleted over time provides insights into your database's activity patterns. You can use this data to identify trends or irregularities, such as insert spikes or an unusual number of deletions.
note
Row metrics only capture row-level changes (
INSERT
,
UPDATE
,
DELETE
, etc.) and exclude table-level operations such as
TRUNCATE
.
Replication delay bytes
The
Replication delay bytes
graph shows the total size, in bytes, of the data that has been sent from the primary compute but has not yet been applied on the replica. A larger value indicates a higher backlog of data waiting to be replicated, which may suggest issues with replication throughput or resource availability on the replica. This graph is only visible when selecting a
Replica
compute from the
Compute
drop-down menu.
Replication delay seconds
The
Replication delay seconds
graph shows the time delay, in seconds, between the last transaction committed on the primary compute and the application of that transaction on the replica. A higher value suggests that the replica is behind the primary, potentially due to network latency, high replication load, or resource constraints on the replica. This graph is only visible when selecting a
Replica
compute from the
Compute
drop-down menu.
Local file cache hit rate
The
Local file cache hit rate
graph shows the percentage of read requests served from Neon's Local File Cache (LFC).
Queries not served from either Postgres shared buffers or the Local File Cache retrieve data from storage, which is more costly and can result in slower query performance. To learn more about how Neon caches data and how the LFC works with Postgres shared buffers, see
What is the Local File Cache?
Working set size
Your working set is the size of the distinct set of Postgres pages (relation data and indexes) accessed in a given time interval - to optimize for performance and consistent latency it is recommended to size your compute so that the working set fits into Neon's
Local File Cache (LFC)
for quick access.
The
Working set size
graph visualizes the amount of data accessed—calculated as unique pages accessed × page size—over a given interval. Here's how to interpret the graph:
5m
(5 minutes): This line shows the data accessed in the last 5 minutes.
15m
(15 minutes): Similar to the 5-minute window, this metric tracks the data accessed in the last 15 minutes.
1h
(1 hour): This line represents the data accessed in the last hour.
Local file cache size
: This is the size of the LFC, which is determined by the size of your compute. Larger computes have larger caches. For cache sizes, see
How to size your compute
.
For optimal performance the local file cache should be larger than your working set size for a given time interval.
If your working set size is larger than the LFC size it is recommended to increase the maximum size of the compute to improve the LFC hit rate and achieve good performance.
If your workload pattern doesn't change much over time it is recommended to compare the 1h time interval working set size with the LFC size and make sure that working set size is smaller than LFC size.

Neon plans
Learn about the different plans offered by Neon
Neon's plans are designed to meet different user requirements, ranging from hobby projects to enterprise-level production workloads. We also offer custom enterprise plans with volume-based discounts for large teams or database fleets. Refer to our
Pricing
page for fees and a detailed plan comparison.
Neon offers four plans:
Free Plan
Launch
Scale
Business
Enterprise
Plan Allowances and Extra Usage
Neon plans are structured around
Allowances
and
Extra usage
. Allowances are included in your plan. With Neon's paid plans, you can purchase
extra usage
in set increments for when you need to go over your allowance.
Free Plan
Neon's Free Plan plan is best for hobby projects, prototypes, and learning Neon.
Free Plan allowances
The Free Plan includes the following usage allowances:
Usage type
Plan allowance
Projects
10 Neon projects
Branches
10 branches per project
Databases
500 per branch
Storage
0.5 GB-month (regular and archive storage combined)
Compute
191.9 compute hours/month—enough to run a primary 0.25 CU compute 24/7; up to 5 of those compute hours can be used for non-default branch computes
Data transfer (Egress)
5 GB per month
What is a compute hour?
A
compute hour
is one
active hour
for a compute with 1 vCPU. For a compute with .25 vCPU, it takes 4
active hours
to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if your compute has 4 vCPUs, it takes only 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
An
active hour
is a measure of the amount of time a compute is active. The time your compute is idle when suspended due to inactivity is not counted.

Free Plan Compute Allowances
On the Free Plan, you have 191.9 compute hours/month—enough to run a primary 0.25 CU compute 24/7. Up to 5 of those compute hours can be used for non-default branch computes. Autoscaling up to 2 vCPU with 8 GB RAM is available for extra performance during peak times, but please be aware that autoscaling can consume your compute hours more quickly, potentially impacting the ability to run a primary 0.25 CU compute 24/7. If you use Autoscaling or Read Replicas, you'll need to monitor your compute hours to ensure you don't run out before the end of the month.
If you go over the 5 compute hour allowance for non-default branch computes, those computes are suspended until the allowance resets at the beginning of the month. If you go over the 191.9 compute hour allowance, all computes are suspended until the beginning of the month.

Neon Read Replicas
Scale your app, run ad-hoc queries, and provide read-only access without duplicating data
Neon read replicas are independent computes designed to perform read operations on the same data as your primary read-write compute. Neon's read replicas do not replicate or duplicate data. Instead, read requests are served from the same storage, as shown in the diagram below. While your read-write queries are directed through your primary compute, read queries can be offloaded to one or more read replicas.
You can instantly create read replicas for any branch in your Neon project and configure the amount of vCPU and memory allocated to each. Read replicas also support Neon's
Autoscaling
and
Scale to Zero
features, providing you with the same control over compute resources that you have with your primary compute.
How are Neon read replicas different?
No additional storage is required
: With read replicas reading from the same source as your primary read-write compute, no additional storage is required to create a read replica. Data is neither duplicated nor replicated. Creating a read replica involves spinning up a read-only compute instance, which takes a few seconds.
You can create them almost instantly
: With no data replication required, you can create read replicas almost instantly.
They are cost-efficient
: With no additional storage or transfer of data, costs associated with storage and data transfer are avoided. Neon's read replicas also benefit from Neon's
Autoscaling
and
Scale to Zero
features, which allow you to manage compute usage.
They are instantly available
: You can allow read replicas to scale to zero when not in use without introducing lag. When a read replica starts up in response to a query, it is up to date with your primary read-write compute almost instantly.
How do you create read replicas?
You can create read replicas using the Neon Console,
Neon CLI
, or
Neon API
, providing the flexibility required to integrate read replicas into your workflow or CI/CD processes.
From the Neon Console, it's a simple
Add Read Replica
action on a branch.
note
You can add read replicas to a branch as needed to accommodate your workload. The Free Plan is limited to a maximum of 3 read replica computes per project.
From the CLI or API:
CLI
API
neon
branches
add-compute
mybranch
--type
read_only
For more details and how to connect to a read replica, see
Create and manage Read Replicas
.
Read Replica architecture
The following diagram shows how your primary compute and read replicas send read requests to the same Pageserver, which is the component of the
Neon architecture
that is responsible for serving read requests.
Neon read replicas are asynchronous, which means they are
eventually consistent
. As updates are made by your primary compute, Safekeepers store the data changes durably until they are processed by Pageservers. At the same time, Safekeepers keep read replica computes up to date with the most recent changes to maintain data consistency.
Cross-region support
Neon only supports creating read replicas
in the same region
as your database. However, a cross-region replica setup can be achieved by creating a Neon project in a different region and replicating data to that project via
logical replication
. For example, you can replicate data from a Neon project in a US region to a Neon project in a European region following our
Neon-to-Neon logical replication guide
. Read-only access to the replicated database can be managed at the application level.
Use cases
Neon's read replicas have a number of applications:
Horizontal scaling
: Scale your application by distributing read requests across replicas to improve performance and increase throughput.
Analytics queries
: Offloading resource-intensive analytics and reporting workloads to reduce load on the primary compute.
Read-only access
: Granting read-only access to users or applications that don't require write permissions.

NAT Gateway IP addresses
A NAT gateway has a public IP address that external systems see when private resources initiate outbound connections. Neon uses 3 to 6 IP addresses per region for this outbound communication, corresponding to each availability zone in the region. To ensure proper connectivity for setups such as replicating data to Neon, you should allow access to all the NAT gateway IP addresses associated with your Neon project's region.
If you are unsure of your project's region, you can find this information in the
Settings
widget on the
Project Dashboard

Move project data to a new region
Moving a project to a different region requires moving your data using one of the following options:
Option 1: Dump and restore
Using the dump and restore method involves the following steps:
Creating a new project in the desired region. For project creation instructions, see
Create a project
.
Moving your data from the old project to the new project. For instructions, see
Import data from Postgres
.
Moving data to a new Neon project using this method may take some time depending on the size of your data. To prevent the loss of data during the import operation, consider disabling writes from your applications before initiating the import operation. You can re-enable writes when the import is completed. Neon does not currently support disabling database writes. Writes must be disabled at the application level.
Option 2: Logical replication
As an alternative to the dump and restore method described above, you can use
logical replication
to replicate data from one Neon project to another for a near-zero downtime data migration. For more information, see
Replicate data from one Neon project to another
.

Scale to Zero
Minimize costs by automatically scaling inactive databases to zero
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature suspends the Neon compute that runs your Postgres database after a period of inactivity, which minimizes costs for databases that aren’t always active, such as development or test environment databases — and even production databases that aren't used 24/7.
When your database is inactive, it automatically scales to zero after 5 minutes. This means you pay only for active time instead of 24/7 compute usage. No manual intervention is required.
Once you query the database again, it reactivates automatically within a few hundred milliseconds.
The diagram below illustrates the
Scale to Zero
behavior alongside Neon's
Autoscaling
feature. The compute usage line highlights an
inactive
period, followed by a period where the compute is automatically suspended until it's accessed again.
Neon compute scales to zero after an
inactive
period of 5 minutes. For
Neon Free Plan
users, this setting is fixed. Paid plan users can disable the scale-to-zero setting to maintain an always-active compute.
You can enable or disable the scale-to-zero setting by editing your compute settings. For detailed instructions, see
Configuring scale to zero for Neon computes

Serverless
Postgres with instant provisioning, no server management, and pay-per-usage billing
Neon takes the world's most loved database — Postgres — and delivers it as a serverless platform, enabling teams to ship reliable and scalable applications faster.
Enabling serverless Postgres begins with Neon's
native decoupling of storage and compute
. By separating these components, Neon can dynamically scale up during periods of high activity and down to zero when idle. Developers can be hands-off instead of sizing infrastructure manually.
This serverless character also makes Neon databases highly agile and well-suited for use cases that require automatic creation, management, and deletion of a high number of Postgres databases, like
database-per-user architectures with thousands of tenants
, as well as
database branching workflows
that accelerate development by enabling the management of dev/testing databases via CI/CD.
Read our
Architecture
section for more information on how Neon is built.
What “serverless” means to us
At Neon, we interpret “serverless” not only as the absence of servers to manage but as a set of principles and features designed to streamline your development process and optimize operational efficiency for your database.
To us, serverless means:
Instant provisioning
: Neon allows you to spin up Postgres databases in seconds, eliminating the long setup times traditionally associated with database provisioning.
No server management
: You don’t have to deal with the complexities of provisioning, maintaining, and administering servers. Neon handles it all, so you can focus on your application.
Autoscaling
: Compute resources automatically scale up or down based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal performance without manual intervention. No restarts are required.
Usage-based pricing
: Your costs are directly tied to the resources your workload consumes—both compute and storage. There's no need to over-provision or pay for idle capacity.
Built-in availability and fault tolerance
: We’ve designed our architecture for high availability and resilience, ensuring your data is safe and your applications are always accessible.
Focus on business logic
: With the heavy lifting of infrastructure management handled by Neon, you can dedicate your time and effort to writing code and delivering value to your users.
To us, serverless does not mean…
That Neon only works with serverless architectures
. Neon is fully compatible with the entire PostgreSQL ecosystem. Whether you're using
Django
,
Rails
, or even a bash script in your basement, if it works with Postgres, it works with Neon.
That you have to pay per query
. Your charges are based on compute and storage usage, not the number of queries. For example, you could run billions of queries for as little as $19 per month if they fit within the resources allotted in the
Launch plan
. The CPU allowance is ample for running sites 24/7 with low CPU requirements.
That you’ll get unpredictable costs due to traffic spikes
. We provide transparency in your potential costs. You always set a maximum autoscaling limit to avoid unpredictable bills, and you can always
check your consumption
. We send you notifications if your storage usage grows quickly.

Issue resolution
Neon will make commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any Issues submitted by customers on eligible plans. Such efforts may (at our discretion) include helping with diagnosis, suggesting workarounds, or changing the Product in a new release. An “Issue” is a material and verifiable failure of the Product to conform to its Documentation. Support will not be provided for the following: (1) use of the Products in a manner inconsistent with the applicable Documentation, (2) modifications to the Products not provided by or approved in writing by Neon, (3) use of the Products with third-party software not provided or approved by Neon. The Customer shall not submit Issues arising from any products other than the Products or otherwise use Support for unsupported products; this includes issues caused by third-party integrations.
Billing issues
If you, the Customer, believe that your invoice or billing receipt is incorrect, we strongly encourage you to contact our Support team rather than filing a dispute with your card provider. Should a payment dispute be filed before getting in touch with us, we are limited in terms of the action we can take to resolve the matter. Once a dispute has been made with the card provider, the account associated with it and all deployments under it may be suspended until it has been resolved.

Severity levels
When the Customer submits an issue (with or without specifying a starting severity), Neon will reasonably assess its severity according to the appropriate severity levels defined below. Neon reserves the right to set, upgrade and downgrade severities of support tickets, on a case-by-case basis, considering any available mitigations, workarounds, and timely cooperation from Customers. Neon will explain the reasoning to the Customer and will resolve any disagreement regarding the severity as soon as is reasonably practicable.
Critical and High-priority levels should not be used for low-impact issues or general questions!
A detailed explanation of each severity level, including several examples, is provided below.
Severity 1 (Critical)
Catastrophic problems in the Customer’s production system leading to loss of service or impact on the Customer’s business
Unavailability of the service
Security breaches that compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the database or its data.
note
If Critical is selected during the case creation, the customer will be asked to provide in-depth details on the business impact the issue has caused.
Examples:
A complete outage of the service provided by Neon
Security breaches
Error impacting the project as a whole (all endpoints/db affected)
Error impacting multiple projects
EP/Branch/DB unreachable
Data corruption/Data loss
Severity 2 (High)
Means a high-impact problem in a customer’s production systems. Essential operations are seriously disrupted, but a workaround exists that allows for continued essential operations.
Non-essential modifications to configuration, like adjusting database parameters or table schema
Minor performance concerns that have minimal impact on database usability
Minor issues related to application integrations, such as minor API connectivity problems
Small-scale challenges with data import/export, data transformation, or data loading processes
Examples:
Partial outage of the service provided by Neon: service usable, but key feature unusable, e.g.:
Cannot create a new branch
Cannot execute a branch
restore
Cannot perform point-in-time recovery (PITR)
Etc.
Any use case that would require a high load of manual work on the customer side to mitigate an issue on our end
Any use case which massively and negatively affects the customer's business
Severity 3 (Normal)
A medium-impact problem on a production or non-production system that involves:
Partial or limited loss of non-critical functionality
A usage problem that involves no loss in functionality
Customers can continue essential operations. Normal problems also include issues with non-production systems, such as test and development systems.
Examples:
RCA for past outages or incidents (no disruption of the service at the moment)
Sporadic connection failure/timeouts/retries
Cannot connect with random third-party framework or tool (but can connect generally speaking)
Any use case which has a minor impact on the customer's business
Poor performing queries/ingestion
Billing issues
Severity 4 (Low)
A general usage question; here is no impact on the product's quality, performance, or functionality in a production or non-production system
Any request for information, enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding the platform
Examples:
Feature requests/feature enablement
General questions (“active time,” “how to backup a DB,” “how to ingest data”) and feedback
Any use case that has no impact on the customer's business at all

Neon Local
Use Docker environments to connect to Neon and manage branches automatically
Neon Local
is a proxy service that creates a local interface to your Neon cloud database. By default, it automatically creates a new database branch when the container starts and deletes it when the container stops.
Your application connects to a local Postgres endpoint, while Neon Local handles routing and authentication to the correct project and branch. This removes the need to update connection strings when working across database branches.
Docker compose instructions
You can add the Neon Local by adding the following to your
docker-compose.yml
file.
Neon serverless driver
node-postgres
db:
image:
neondatabase/neon_local:latest
ports:
-
'5432:5432'
environment:
NEON_API_KEY:
${NEON_API_KEY}
NEON_PROJECT_ID:
${NEON_PROJECT_ID}
DRIVER:
serverless
Docker run instructions
You can also run the Neon Local container with the following Docker run command.

Persistent Neon Branch per Git Branch
If you want Neon Local to create a branch that matches your Git branch, provide two volume mounts:
A mount that persists Neon branch metadata within your project
A mount that exposes the current Git branch name
note
This will automatically create a
.neon_local
folder in your project to store branch metadata. Be sure to add this folder to your
.gitignore
to avoid committing database connection information to version control.

Git integration using Docker on Mac
If using Docker Desktop for Mac, make sure that your Virtual Machine is set to use gRPC FUSE, not VirtioFS. This allows Neon Local to detect git branch changes. There is currently a bug with VirtioFS that can prevent containers from being properly updated when local files change while the container is running.

Account Recovery
How to recvoer a lost account
If a former employee owned a Neon account and didn’t shut it down or transfer access before leaving, you can follow the steps outlined below to recover the account.
Regain access through the original login method
First, determine how the account was accessed.
A. If the account used a third-party login
If the former employee signed up with a third-party identity provider (e.g., Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Hasura), you must recover access to that account through your organization's identity provider. Neon cannot bypass third-party authentication.
B. If the account used email and password
If you have access to the former employee's company email account:
Go to the
Neon login page
Click
Forgot Password
Enter the former employee's email address
Access the password reset link from their inbox
Set a new password and sign in
Once signed in, you can:
Update the email address
Transfer project ownership
Add an admin
to your projects or organization
Update billing details
note
For security reasons, we recommend immediately revoking access to company email accounts when employees leave your organization.
If you cannot access the email or login method
If the original login method is inaccessible, we can assist through a manual identity verification process.
To begin:
Open a
Neon Support ticket
from your Neon account.
Provide:
A signed statement on company letterhead explaining the situation
Contact details for another employee at your company
Neon will:
Notify the email address associated with the account and wait 24 business hours (Mon–Fri) for a response
Send you a document to sign electronically
Schedule a short video call to verify your identity (please have a government-issued ID ready)
info
Neon will not store or copy your ID. It's used only to confirm that the person on the call is who they say they are.
Once all steps are complete, we'll grant access to the account or transfer project ownership as needed.
important
Neon Support may request additional information during or after the verification process. Manual account recovery is a sensitive procedure designed to protect your organization's data and prevent unauthorized access.

Accounts
Manage your Neon account
Your
Neon account
is your personal identity for logging in, managing your profile, and authenticating actions across all organizations you belong to.
Account settings
You can access your Neon account settings from anywhere in the Console. Just click your profile avatar and select
Account settings
from the menu.
Here's what you can do from
Account settings
.
Update personal information
Change your name or email address.
If you signed up with email
By default, your email will be used as your first name. You may want to add your first and last name here to complete your profile. Your email is your login and where we'll send all account communications.
If you signed up with Google, GitHub, or another provider
Your name and email come from your social account. Feel free to change your name to whatever works for you. If you change your email, we'll unlink your social account and switch you to email sign-in. After that, you'll use your new email and password to log in.
Changing your email
If you change your email (whether you started with email or social login), you'll get a verification email to confirm. Once confirmed, your new address becomes your login. If you're using a social login and change your email, we'll unlink your social account and switch you to email sign-in.
Change your email in the Neon Console
Need to switch your login method?
If you signed up with Google or GitHub
, you can switch to email login by changing your email and setting a password.
If you signed up with email,
it's not currently possible to switch to a social login.
Contact Support
and we'll help you out.
Change password
No surprises here — just enter your current password, then your new one (twice). We'll enforce our current password rules for your security.
Create personal API keys
Personal API keys let you securely interact with the
Neon API
, including through command-line tools, scripts, or third-party integrations that use the API.. Your personal API key works for any organization you belong to — so you can manage projects, automate tasks, or use integrations across all your orgs with a single key. The actions you can perform with your key depend on your role in each org (admin, member, or collaborator). You can create, view, and revoke your personal API keys here in your account settings.
Learn more about API keys
Delete account
Delete your Neon account after leaving or deleting all orgs and projects.
Leaving an org
If you're the only admin, promote another member to admin first. You can then leave the org.
Deleting an org
Remove all members (so you're the only one left), delete all projects, and you can then delete the org.
Once you have no orgs left, you can then click
Delete
.
What happens after you delete your account
You'll receive a confirmation email.
If you change your mind, you can reactivate your account by logging in again within 30 days. Your personal info will be restored, though not your API keys.
After 30 days, your account and all related data will be permanently deleted.

Manage API Keys
Most actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the
Neon API
. You'll need an API key to validate your requests. Each key is a randomly-generated 64-bit token that you must include when calling Neon API methods. All keys remain valid until deliberately revoked.
Types of API keys
Neon supports three types of API keys:
Key Type
Who Can Create
Scope
Validity
Personal API Key
Any user
All organization projects where the user is a member
Valid until revoked; org project access ends if user leaves organization
Organization API Key
Organization administrators
All projects within the organization
Valid until revoked
Project-scoped API Key
Any organization member
Single specified project
Valid until revoked or project leaves organization
While there is no strict limit on the number of API keys you can create, we recommend keeping it under 10,000 per Neon account.
Creating API keys
You'll need to create your first API key from the Neon Console, where you are already authenticated. You can then use that key to generate new keys from the API.
note
When creating API keys from the Neon Console, the secret token will be displayed only once. Copy it immediately and store it securely in a credential manager (like AWS Key Management Service or Azure Key Vault) — you won't be able to retrieve it later. If you lose an API key, you'll need to revoke it and create a new one.
Create a personal API key
You can create a personal API key in the Neon Console or using the Neon API.
Console

Create an organization API key
Organization API keys provide admin-level access to all organization resources. Only organization admins can create these keys. To create an organization API key, you must use your personal API key and be an administrator in the organization. Neon will verify your admin status before allowing the key creation.

Make an API call
The following example demonstrates how to use your API key to retrieve projects:
curl
'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects'
\
-H
'Accept: application/json'
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
|
jq
where:
"https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects"
is the resource URL, which includes the base URL for the Neon API and the
/projects
endpoint.
The
"Accept: application/json"
in the header specifies the accepted response type.
The
Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY
entry in the header specifies your API key. Replace
$NEON_API_KEY
with an actual 64-bit API key. A request without this header, or containing an invalid or revoked API key, fails and returns a
401 Unauthorized
HTTP status code.
jq
is an optional third-party tool that formats the JSON response, making it easier to read.

Neon on Azure
Use Neon on Azure as a Native ISV Service
Neon is available on the Azure Marketplace
as an
Azure Native ISV Service
, allowing you to work with Neon the same way you work with other native solutions from Microsoft. Billing is handled directly through Azure, and you can choose from Neon pricing plans when deploying the service.
Key benefits
Deploying Neon natively on Azure lets you manage your Neon organization alongside the rest of your Azure infrastructure. Key benefits include:
Azure-native management
: Provision and manage Neon organizations directly from the Azure portal.
Single sign-on (SSO)
: Access Neon using your Azure credentials—no separate logins required.
Consolidated billing
: Simplify cost management with unified billing through the Azure Marketplace.
Integrated workflows
: Use the Azure CLI and SDKs to manage Neon as part of your regular workflows, integrated with your existing Azure resources.
note
Management of Neon organizations, projects, and branches is supported via the Azure portal, CLI, and SDK. We continue to enhance the integration between Neon and Azure, including with other Azure native services. Additional Neon features and advanced configurations remain accessible through the Neon Console.

Automate pg_dump backups
Automate backups of your Neon database to S3 with pg_dump and GitHub Actions
Keeping regular backups of your database is critical for protecting against data loss. While Neon offers an
instant restore
feature (point-in-time restore) for backups of up to 30 days, there are scenarios—such as business continuity, disaster recovery, or regulatory compliance—where maintaining independent and longer-lived backup files may be necessary. In these cases, using the Postgres
pg_dump
tool to create backups and storing them on a reliable external service (like an AWS S3 bucket) gives you control over long-term retention and recovery of your data.
Manually performing backups can be tedious and time consuming, so automation is key to ensure you're taking backups consistently. An automated backup process also lets you enforce retention policies by automatically cleaning up old backups, saving storage, and keeping your backup repository tidy.
This two-part guide walks you through setting up an automated backup pipeline using
pg_dump
and GitHub Actions. You will configure everything needed to run nightly backups and store them in S3, ensuring your data is available to restore if needed.
Part 1: Create an S3 bucket to store backups
Set up an AWS S3 bucket for storing backups
Part 2: Automate with GitHub Actions
Schedule nightly backups with GitHub Actions and pg_dump

Backups with pg_dump
Learn how to create a backup of your Neon database using pg_dump
This topic describes how to create a backup of your Neon database using the Postgres
pg_dump
utility and how to restore a backup using
pg_restore
.
important
Avoid using
pg_dump
over a
pooled connection string
(see PgBouncer issues
452
&
976
for details). Use an
unpooled connection string
instead.
Prerequisites
Make sure
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
are installed. You can verify by running
pg_dump -V
.
We recommend using the latest versions of
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
, and ensuring that the client version matches your Neon project's Postgres version (14–17).
Install
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
If you don't have the
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
utilities installed locally, you'll need to install them on your preferred platform.
Windows
Mac
Linux
Docker
Install PostgreSQL using the official installer from
https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
.
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
are installed by default and can be found in the PostgreSQL
bin
directory.
Creating a backup with
pg_dump
Following this procedure will create a database backup locally, where you're running the
pg_dump
command.
Retrieve the connection string for your Neon database by navigating to your Neon
Project Dashboard
and clicking the
Connect
button to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Deselect the
Connection pooling
option. You need a direct connection string, not a pooled one.
Your connection string should look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode
=require
Create a backup of your Neon database by running the following
pg_dump
command with your Neon database connection string.
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
"<neon_database_connection_string>"
-f
<
dump_file_nam
e
>
After adding your Neon database connection string and a dump file name, your command will look something like this:
pg_dump
-Fc
-v
-d
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
-f
mydatabase.bak
The
pg_dump
command above includes these arguments:
-Fc
: Sends the output to a custom-format archive suitable for input into
pg_restore
.
-v
: Runs
pg_dump
in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the dump operation.
-d
: Specifies the
connection string
for your Neon database.
-f <dump_file_name>
: The dump file name. It can be any name you choose (
mydumpfile.bak
, for example).
For more command options, see
Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options
.
Restoring a backup with
pg_restore
This procedure shows how to restore a database using the
pg_restore
utility from a backup file created using
pg_dump
, as described above.
Create a new Neon project.
Create a database with the same name as the one you backed up. The
pg_dump
instructions above created a backup of a database named
neondb
. Your database name is likely different.
Retrieve the connection string for your Neon database:
Go to your Neon project and click the
Connect
button to open the
Connect to your database
modal.
Deselect the
Connection pooling
option. You need a direct connection string, not a pooled one.
Your connection string should look something like this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-dry-morning-a8vn5za2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode
=require
Restore your data to the target database in Neon with
pg_restore
.
pg_restore
-v
-d
"<neon_database_connection_string>"
<
dump_file_nam
e
>
After adding your Neon database connection string and the dump file name, your command will look something like this:
pg_restore
-v
-d
"postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-dry-morning-a8vn5za2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
mydatabase.bak
The example above includes these arguments:
-v
: Runs
pg_restore
in verbose mode, allowing you to monitor what happens during the restore operation.
-d
: Specifies the Neon database to connect to. The value is a Neon database connection string. See
Before you begin
.
<dump_file_name>
is the name of the dump file you created with
pg_dump
.
For more command options, see
Advanced pg_dump and pg_restore options
.
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
example
The following example shows how data is dumped from source database named
neondb
in one Neon project and restored to a
neondb
database in another Neon project using the commands described in the previous sections. (A database named
neondb
was created in the Neon project prior to running the restore operation.)
Before performing this procedure:
A new Neon project was created for the destination database, and a database with the same name as the source database was created (
neondb
)
Connection strings for the source and destination databases were collected:
source:
postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_AbC123dEf@ep-dry-morning-a8vn5za2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
destination:
postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_AbC123dEf@ep-dry-morning-a8vn5za2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
~

Instant restore
Neon supports different backup strategies, which you can use separately or in combination, depending on your requirements.
Instant restore
With Neon's instant restore capability, also known as point-in-time restore or PITR, you can automatically retain a "history" of changes—ranging from 1 day up to 30 days, depending on your Neon plan. This feature lets you restore your database to any specific moment without the need for traditional database backups or separate backup automation. It's ideal if your primary concern is fast recovery after an unexpected event.
By default, Neon projects retain
1 day
of history. You can increase your restore window on Neon as follows:
Plan
Restore window limit
Free
1 day
Launch
7 days
Scale
14 days
Business
30 days
With this strategy, the only required action is setting your desired restore window. Please keep in mind that increasing your restore window also increases storage, as changes to your data are retained for a longer period.
To get started, see
Instant restore
.
Backups with
pg_dump
For business continuity, disaster recovery, or compliance, you can use standard Postgres tools to back up and restore your database. Neon supports traditional backup workflows using
pg_dump
and
pg_restore
.
To learn how, see
Backups with pg_dump
.
Automated backups with
pg_dump
If you need to automate
pg_dump
backups to remote storage, we provide a two-part guide that walks you through setting up an S3 bucket and a GitHub Action to automate
pg_dump
backups on a recurring schedule. You'll also learn how to configure retention settings to manage how long
pg_dump
backups are stored before being deleted.

Manage branches
Data resides in a branch. Each Neon project is created with a
root branch
called
main
, which is also designated as your
default branch
. You can create child branches from
main
or from previously created branches. A branch can contain multiple databases and roles. Neon's
plan allowances
define the number of branches you can create.
A child branch is a copy-on-write clone of the parent branch. You can modify the data in a branch without affecting the data in the parent branch.
For more information about branches and how you can use them in your development workflows, see
Branching
.
You can create and manage branches using the Neon Console,
Neon CLI
, or
Neon API
.
important
When working with branches, it is important to remove old and unused branches. Branches hold a lock on the data they contain, which will add to your storage usage as they age out of your project's
restore window
.
Create a branch
To create a branch:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
.
Click
Create branch
to open the branch creation dialog.
Select the
Data and schema
option (the default) to create a branch with both schema and data. If you're interested in schema-only branches, see
Schema-only branches
.
Enter a name for the branch.
Select a parent branch — the branch you want to branch from.
Select an
Include data up to
option to specify the data to be included in your branch.
note
The
Specific date and time
and the
Specific Log Sequence Number Data
options do not include data changes that occurred after the specified date and time or LSN. You can only specify a date and time or LSN value that falls within your
restore window
.
Click
Create new branch
.
You are presented with the connection details for your new branch and directed to the
Branch
overview page where you are shown the details for your new branch.
Postgres role passwords on branches
When creating a new branch, the branch will have the same Postgres roles and passwords as the parent branch. If you want your branch created with new role passwords, you can enable
branch protection
.
View branches
To view the branches in a Neon project:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
to view all current branches in the project.

Branch archiving
On the Free Plan, Neon automatically archives inactive branches to cost-efficient archive storage after a defined threshold. For more, see
Branch archiving
.
Rename a branch
Neon permits renaming a branch, including your project's default branch. To rename a branch:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
to view the branches for the project.
Select a branch from the table.
On the branch overview page, click the
Actions
drop-down menu and select
Rename
.
Specify a new name for the branch and click
Save
.
Set a branch as default
Each Neon project is created with a default branch called
main
, but you can designate any branch as your project's default branch. The advantage of the default branch is that it has a larger compute hour allowance on the Free Plan. For users on paid plans, the compute associated with the default branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available. For more information, see
Default branch
.
To set a branch as the default branch:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
to view the branches for the project.
Select a branch from the table.
On the branch overview page, click the
Actions
drop-down menu and select
Set as default
.
In the
Set as default
confirmation dialog, click
Set as default
to confirm your selection.
Set a branch as protected
This feature is available on all Neon's paid plans, which supports up to five protected branches.
To set a branch as protected:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
to view the branches for the project.
Select a branch from the table.
On the branch overview page, click the
Actions
drop-down menu and select
Set as protected
.
In the
Set as protected
confirmation dialog, click
Set as protected
to confirm your selection.
For details and configuration instructions, refer to our
Protected branches guide
.
Connect to a branch
Connecting to a database in a branch requires connecting via a compute associated with the branch. The following steps describe how to connect using
psql
and a connection string obtained from the Neon Console.
tip
You can also query the databases in a branch from the Neon SQL Editor. For instructions, see
Query with Neon's SQL Editor
.
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Find the connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Select the branch, the database, and the role you want to connect with.
Copy the connection string. A connection string includes your role name, the compute hostname, and database name.
Connect with
psql
as shown below.
psql
postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
tip
A compute hostname starts with an
ep-
prefix. You can also find a compute hostname on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console. See
View branches
.
If you want to connect from an application, the
Connect to your database modal
, accessed by clicking
Connect
on the project
Dashboard
, and the
Frameworks
and
Languages
sections in the documentation provide various connection examples.
Reset a branch from parent
You can use Neon's
Reset from parent
feature to instantly update a branch with the latest schema and data from its parent. This feature can be an integral part of your CI/CD automation.
You can use the Neon Console, CLI, or API. For details, see
Reset from parent
.
Restore a branch to its own or another branch's history
There are several restore operations available using Neon's instant restore feature:
Restore a branch to its own history
Restore a branch to the head of another branch
Restore a branch to the history of another branch
You can use the Neon Console, CLI, or API. For more details, see
Instant restore
.
Delete a branch
Deleting a branch is a permanent action. Deleting a branch also deletes the databases and roles that belong to the branch as well as the compute associated with the branch. You cannot delete a branch that has child branches. The child branches must be deleted first.
To delete a branch:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Branches
.
Select a branch from the table.
On the branch overview page, click the
Actions
drop-down menu and select
Delete
.
On the confirmation dialog, click
Delete
.
Check the data size
You can check the logical data size for the databases on a branch by viewing the
Data size
value on the
Branches
page or page in the Neon Console. Alternatively, you can run the following query on your branch from the
Neon SQL Editor
or any SQL client connected to your database:
SELECT
pg_size_pretty(
sum
(pg_database_size(datname)))
FROM
pg_database;
The query value may differ slightly from the
Data size
reported in the Neon Console.
Data size is your logical data size. It does not include the
history
that Neon retains to support features like instant restore.
Branch types
Neon has different branch types with different characteristics.
Root branch
A root branch is a branch without a parent branch. Each Neon project starts with a root branch named
main
, which cannot be deleted and is set as the
default branch
for the project.
Neon also supports two other types of root branches that have no parent but
can
be deleted:
Backup branches
, created by instant restore operations on other root branches.
Schema-only branches
.
The number of root branches allowed in a project depends on your Neon plan.
Plan
Root branch allowance per project
Free
3
Launch
5
Scale
10
Business
25
Default branch
Each Neon project has a default branch. In the Neon Console, your default branch is identified by a
DEFAULT
tag. You can designate any branch as the default branch for your project.
The default branch has a larger compute hour allowance that non-default branches on the Free Plan. For users on paid plans, the compute associated with the default branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available.
Non-default branch
Any branch not designated as the default branch is considered a non-default branch. You can rename or delete non-default branches.
For Neon Free Plan users, computes associated with
non-default branches
are suspended if you exceed the Neon Free Plan 5 hours per month for
non-default branches
.
For users on paid plans, default limits prevent more than 20 concurrently active computes. Beyond that limit, a compute associated with a non-default branch remains suspended.
Protected branch
Neon's protected branches feature implements a series of protections:
Protected branches cannot be deleted.
Protected branches cannot be
reset
.
Projects with protected branches cannot be deleted.
Computes associated with a protected branch cannot be deleted.
New passwords are automatically generated for Postgres roles on branches created from protected branches.
See below
.
With additional configuration steps, you can apply IP Allow restrictions to protected branches only. The
IP Allow
feature is available on the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plans. See
below
.
Protected branches are not
archived
due to inactivity.
Typically, a protected status is given to a branch or branches that hold production data or sensitive data. The protected branch feature is only supported on Neon's paid plans. See
Set a branch as protected
.
Schema-only branch
A branch that replicates only the database schema from a source branch, without copying any of the actual data. This feature is particularly valuable when working with sensitive information. Rather than creating branches that include confidential data, you can duplicate just the database structure and then populate it with your own data.
Schema-only branches are
root branches
, meaning they have no parent. As a root branch, each schema-only branch starts an independent line of data in a Neon project.
See
Schema-only branches
.
Backup branch
A branch created by an
instant restore
operation. When you restore a branch from a particular point in time, the current branch is saved as a backup branch. Performing a restore operation on a root branch, creates a backup branch without a parent branch (a root branch). See
Instant restore
.
Branching with the Neon CLI
The Neon CLI supports creating and managing branches. For instructions, see
Neon CLI commands — branches
. For a Neon CLI branching guide, see
Branching with the Neon CLI
.
Branching with the Neon API
Branch actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete branches using the Neon API. For other branch-related API methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
note
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all of the attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the examples shown below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.
note
To learn more about the types of API keys you can create — personal, organization, or project-scoped — see
Manage API Keys
.
Create a branch with the API
The following Neon API method creates a branch. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
POST
/projects/{project_id}/branches
The API method appears as follows when specified in a cURL command. The
endpoints
attribute creates a compute, which is required to connect to the branch. A branch can be created with or without a compute. The
branch
attribute specifies the parent branch.
note
This method does not require a request body. Without a request body, the method creates a branch from the project's default branch, and a compute is not created.

Manage computes
A compute is a virtualized service that runs applications. In Neon, a compute runs Postgres.
Each project has a primary read-write compute for its
default branch
. Neon supports both read-write and
read replica
computes. A branch can have one primary (read-write) compute and multiple read replica computes. A compute is required to connect to a Neon branch (where your database resides) from a client or application.
To connect to a database in a branch, you must use a compute associated with that branch. The following diagram illustrates how an application connects to a branch via its compute:
Project
|---- default branch (main) ---- compute <--- application/client
|    |
|    |---- database
|
---- child branch ---- compute <--- application/client
|
|---- database
Your Neon plan determines the resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute. The
Neon Free Plan
supports computes with up to 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM. Paid plans offer larger compute sizes. Larger computes consume more compute hours over the same period of active time than smaller computes.
View a compute
A compute is associated with a branch. To view a compute, select
Branches
in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute, it is shown on the
Computes
tab on the branch page.
Compute details shown on the
Computes
tab include:
The type of compute, which can be
Primary
(read-write) or
Read Replica
(read-only).
The compute status, typically
Active
or
Idle
.
Endpoint ID
: The compute endpoints ID, which always starts with an
ep-
prefix; for example:
ep-quiet-butterfly-w2qres1h
Size
: The size of the compute. Shows autoscaling minimum and maximum vCPU values if autoscaling is enabled.
Last active
: The date and time the compute was last active.
Edit

Monitor
, and
Connect
actions for a compute can be accessed from the
Computes
tab.
Create a compute
You can only create a single primary read-write compute for a branch that does not have a compute, but a branch can have multiple read replica computes.
To create an endpoint:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
On the
Computes
tab, click
Add a compute
or
Add Read Replica
if you already have a primary read-write compute.
On the
Add new compute
drawer or
Add read replica
drawer, specify your compute settings, and click
Add
. Selecting the
Read replica
compute type creates a
read replica
.
Edit a compute
You can edit a compute to change the
compute size
or
scale to zero
configuration.
To edit a compute:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
From the
Computes
tab, select
Edit
for the compute you want to edit.
The
Edit
drawer opens, letting you modify settings such as compute size, the autoscaling configuration (if applicable), and your scale to zero setting.
Once you've made your changes, click
Save
. All changes take immediate effect.
For information about selecting an appropriate compute size or autoscaling configuration, see
How to size your compute
.
What happens to the compute when making changes
Some key points to understand about how your endpoint responds when you make changes to your compute settings:
Changing the size of your fixed compute restarts the endpoint and
temporarily disconnects all existing connections
.
note
When your compute resizes automatically as part of the autoscaling feature, there are no restarts or disconnects; it just scales.
Editing minimum or maximum autoscaling sizes also requires a restart; existing connections are temporarily disconnected.
If you disable scale to zero, you may need to restart your compute manually to get the latest compute-related release updates from Neon if updates are not applied automatically by a
scheduled update
. Scheduled updates are applied according to certain criteria, so not all computes receive these updates automatically. See
Restart a compute
.
To avoid prolonged interruptions resulting from compute restarts, we recommend configuring your clients and applications to reconnect automatically in case of a dropped connection. See
Handling connection disruptions
.
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
You can change compute size settings when
editing a compute
.
Compute size
is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CUs have 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the vCPUs, as shown in the table below.

Neon supports fixed-size and autoscaling compute configurations.
Fixed size:
Select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 56 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
Autoscaling:
Specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries in response to the current load. Currently, the
Autoscaling
feature supports a range of 1/4 (.25) CU to 16 CUs. The 1/4 CU and 1/2 CU settings are
shared compute
. For information about how Neon implements the
Autoscaling
feature, see
Autoscaling
.
monitoring autoscaling
For information about monitoring your compute as it scales up and down, see
Monitor autoscaling
.
How to size your compute
The size of your compute determines the amount of frequently accessed data you can cache in memory and the maximum number of simultaneous connections you can support. As a result, if your compute size is too small, this can lead to suboptimal query performance and connection limit issues.
In Postgres, the
shared_buffers
setting defines the amount of data that can be held in memory. In Neon, the
shared_buffers
parameter
scales with compute size
and Neon also uses a Local File Cache (LFC) to extend the amount of memory available for caching data. The LFC can use up to 75% of your compute's RAM.
The Postgres
max_connections
setting defines your compute's maximum simultaneous connection limit and is set according to your compute size configuration.
The following table outlines the vCPU, RAM, LFC size (75% of RAM), and the
max_connections
limit for each compute size that Neon supports. To understand how
max_connections
is determined for an autoscaling configuration, see
Parameter settings that differ by compute size
.
note
Compute size support differs by
Neon plan
. Autoscaling is supported up to 16 CU. Neon supports fixed compute sizes (no autoscaling) for computes sizes larger than 16 CU.

When selecting a compute size, ideally, you want to keep as much of your dataset in memory as possible. This improves performance by reducing the amount of reads from storage. If your dataset is not too large, select a compute size that will hold the entire dataset in memory. For larger datasets that cannot be fully held in memory, select a compute size that can hold your
working set
. Selecting a compute size for a working set involves advanced steps, which are outlined below. See
Sizing your compute based on the working set
.
Regarding connection limits, you'll want a compute size that can support your anticipated maximum number of concurrent connections. If you are using
Autoscaling
, it is important to remember that your
max_connections
setting is based on both your minimum and the maximum compute size. See
Parameter settings that differ by compute size
for details. To avoid any
max_connections
constraints, you can use a pooled connection with your application, which supports up to 10,000 concurrent user connections. See
Connection pooling
.
Sizing your compute based on the working set
If it's not possible to hold your entire dataset in memory, the next best option is to ensure that your working set is in memory. A working set is your frequently accessed or recently used data and indexes. To determine whether your working set is fully in memory, you can query the cache hit ratio for your Neon compute. The cache hit ratio tells you how many queries are served from memory. Queries not served from memory bypass the cache to retrieve data from Neon storage (the
Pageserver
), which can affect query performance.
As mentioned above, Neon computes use a Local File Cache (LFC) to extend Postgres shared buffers. You can monitor the Local File Cache hit rate and your working set size from Neon's
Monitoring
page, where you'll find the following charts:
Local file cache hit rate
Working set size
Neon also provides a
neon
extension with a
neon_stat_file_cache
view that you can use to query the cache hit ratio for your compute's Local File Cache. For more information, see
The neon extension
.
Autoscaling considerations
Autoscaling is most effective when your data (either your full dataset or your working set) can be fully cached in memory on the minimum compute size in your autoscaling configuration.
Consider this scenario: If your data size is approximately 6 GB, starting with a compute size of .25 CU can lead to suboptimal performance because your data cannot be adequately cached. While your compute
will
scale up from .25 CU on demand, you may experience poor query performance until your compute scales up and fully caches your working set. You can avoid this issue if your minimum compute size can hold your working set in memory.
As mentioned above, your
max_connections
setting is based on both your minimum and maximum compute size settings. To avoid any
max_connections
constraints, you can use a pooled connection for your application. See
Connection pooling
.
Scale to zero configuration
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature automatically transitions a compute into an idle state after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can disable scale to zero to maintain an "always-active" compute. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few hundred milliseconds seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute but is likely to increase your compute time usage on systems where the database is not always active.
For more information, refer to
Configuring scale to zero for Neon computes
.
important
If you disable scale to zero, you may need to restart your compute manually to get the latest compute-related release updates from Neon if updates are not applied automatically by a
scheduled update
. Scheduled updates are applied according to certain criteria, so not all computes receive these updates automatically. See
Restart a compute
.
Restart a compute
It is sometimes necessary to restart a compute. Reasons for restarting a compute might include:
Applying upgraded limits after upgrading to a paid plan
Picking up the latest compute-related updates, which Neon typically releases weekly
Picking up a new Postgres extension or extension version released by Neon
Resolving performance issues or unexpected behavior
Restarting ensures your compute is running with the latest configurations and improvements.
important
Restarting a compute interrupts any connections currently using the compute. To avoid prolonged interruptions resulting from compute restarts, we recommend configuring your clients and applications to reconnect automatically in case of a dropped connection.
You can restart a compute using one of the following methods:
Issue a
Restart compute endpoint
call using the Neon API. You can do this directly from the Neon API Reference using the
Try It!
feature or via the command line with a cURL command similar to the one shown below. You'll need your
project ID
, compute
endpoint ID
, and an
API key
.
curl
--request
POST
\
--url
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/cool-forest-86753099/endpoints/ep-calm-flower-a5b75h79/restart
\
--header
'accept: application/json'
\
--header
'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
note
The
Restart compute endpoint
API only works on an active compute. If you're compute is idle, you can wake it up with a query or the
Start compute endpoint
API.
Stop activity on your compute (stop running queries) and wait for your compute to suspend due to inactivity. By default, Neon suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can watch the status of your compute on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console. Select your branch and monitor your compute's
Status
field. Wait for it to report an
Idle
status. The compute will restart the next time it's accessed, and the status will change to
Active
.
Delete a compute
A branch can have a single read-write compute and multiple read replica computes. You can delete any of these computes from a branch. However, be aware that a compute is required to connect to a branch and access its data. If you delete a compute and add it back later, the new compute will have different connection details.
To delete a compute:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
On the
Computes
tab, click
Edit
for the compute you want to delete.
At the bottom of the
Edit compute
drawer, click
Delete compute
.
Manage computes with the Neon API
Compute actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the
Neon API
. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete computes using the Neon API. For other compute-related API methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
note
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the cURL examples below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.
note
To learn more about the types of API keys you can create — personal, organization, or project-scoped — see
Manage API Keys
.

Compute-related issues
This section outlines compute-related issues you may encounter and possible resolutions.
No space left on device
You may encounter an error similar to the following when your compute's local disk storage is full:
ERROR:
could
not
write
to
file
"base/pgsql_tmp/pgsql_tmp1234.56.fileset/o12of34.p1.0"
:
No
space
left
on
device
(SQLSTATE
53100
)
Neon computes allocate 20 GiB of local disk space or 15 GiB x the maximum compute size (whichever is highest) for temporary files used by Postgres. Data-intensive operations can sometimes consume all of this space, resulting in
No space left on device
errors.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following strategies:
Identify and terminate resource-intensive processes
: These could be long-running queries, operations, or possibly sync or replication activities. You can start your investigation by
listing running queries by duration
.
Optimize queries to reduce temporary file usage
.
Adjust pipeline settings for third-party sync or replication
: If you're syncing or replicating data with an external service, modify the pipeline settings to control disk space usage.
If the issue persists, refer to our
Neon Support channels
.
Compute is not suspending
In some cases, you may observe that your compute remains constantly active for no apparent reason. Possible causes for a constantly active compute when not expected include:
Connection requests
: Frequent connection requests from clients, applications, or integrations can prevent a compute from suspending automatically. Each connection resets the scale to zero timer.
Background processes
: Some applications or background jobs may run periodic tasks that keep the connection active.
Possible steps you can take to identify the issues include:
Checking for active processes
You can run the following query to identify active sessions and their states:
SELECT
pid,
usename,
query,
state
,
query_start
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE
query_start
>=
now
()
-
interval
'24 hours'
ORDER BY
query_start
DESC
;
Look for processes initiated by your users, applications, or integrations that may be keeping your compute active.
Review connection patterns
Ensure that no applications are sending frequent, unnecessary connection requests.
Consider batching connections if possible, or use
connection pooling
to limit persistent connections.
Optimize any background jobs
If background jobs are needed, reduce their frequency or adjust their timing to allow Neon's scale to zero feature to activate after the defined period of inactivity (the default is 5 minutes). For more information, refer to our
Scale to zero guide

Manage database access
Learn how to manage user access to databases in your Neon project
Each Neon project is created with a Postgres role that is named for your database. For example, if your database is named
neondb
, the project is created with a role named
neondb_owner
.
This Postgres role is automatically assigned the
neon_superuser
role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, and sequences. Any user created with the Neon Console, Neon API, or Neon CLI is also assigned the
neon_superuser
role.
It is good practice to reserve
neon_superuser
roles for database administration tasks like creating roles and databases. For other users, we recommend creating roles with specific sets of permissions based on application and access requirements. Then, assign the appropriate roles to your users. The roles you create should adhere to a
least privilege
model, granting only the permissions required to accomplish their tasks.
But how do you create roles with limited access? The following sections describe how to create read-only and read-write roles and assign those roles to users. We'll also look at how to create a "developer" role and grant that role full access to a database on a development branch in a Neon project.
A word about users, groups, and roles in Postgres
In Postgres, users, groups, and roles are the same thing. From the PostgreSQL
Database Roles
documentation:
PostgreSQL manages database access permissions using the concept of roles. A role can be thought of as either a database user, or a group of database users, depending on how the role is set up.
Neon recommends granting privileges to roles, and then assigning those roles to your database users.
Creating roles with limited access
You can create roles with limited access via SQL. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic
public schema privileges
granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the
neon_superuser
role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object.
The recommended approach to creating roles with limited access is as follows:
Use your Neon role to create roles for each application or use case via SQL. For example, create
readonly
and
readwrite
roles.
Grant privileges to those roles to allow access to database objects. For example, grant the
SELECT
privilege to a
readonly
role, or grant
SELECT
,
INSERT
,
UPDATE
, and
DELETE
privileges to a
readwrite
role.
Create your database users. For example, create users named
readonly_user1
and
readwrite_user1
.
Assign the
readonly
or
readwrite
role to those users to grant them the privileges associated with those roles. For example, assign the
readonly
role to
readonly_user1
, and the
readwrite
role to
readwrite_user1
.
note
You can remove a role from a user at any time to revoke privileges. See
Revoke privileges
.
Create a read-only role
This section describes how to create a read-only role with access to a specific database and schema. An SQL statement summary is provided at the end.
info
In Postgres, access must be granted at the database, schema, and object level. For example, to grant access to a table, you must also grant access to the database and schema in which the table resides. If these access permissions are not defined, the role will not be able access the table.
To create a read-only role:
Connect to your database from an SQL client such as
psql
,
pgAdmin
, or the
Neon SQL Editor
. If you need help connecting, see
Connect from any client
.
Create a
readonly
role using the following statement.
CREATE
ROLE
readonly
PASSWORD
'<password>'
;
The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see
Manage roles with SQL
.
note
Neon also supports the
NOLOGIN
option:
CREATE ROLE role_name NOLOGIN;
This allows you to define roles that cannot authenticate but can be granted privileges.
Grant the
readonly
role read-only privileges on the schema. Replace
<database>
and
<schema>
with actual database and schema names, respectively.
-- Grant permission to connect to the database
GRANT
CONNECT
ON
DATABASE
<database>
TO
readonly
;
-- Grant USAGE on the schema
GRANT

ALTER
DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES
IN
SCHEMA
<schema>
GRANT
SELECT
ON
TABLES
TO
readonly
;
Create a database user. The password requirements mentioned above apply here as well.
CREATE
ROLE

WITH
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'<password>'
;
Assign the
readonly
role to
readonly_user1
:
GRANT
readonly
TO
readonly_user1;
The
readonly_user1
user now has read-only access to tables in the specified schema and database and should be able to connect and run
SELECT
queries.

Create a developer role
This section describes how to create a "development branch" and grant developers full access to a database on the development branch. To accomplish this, we create a developer role on the "parent" branch, create a development branch, and then assign users to the developer role on the development branch.
As you work through the steps in this scenario, remember that when you create a branch in Neon, you are creating a clone of the parent branch, which includes the roles and databases on the parent branch.
To get started:
Connect to the database
on the parent branch
from an SQL client such as
psql
,
pgAdmin
, or the
Neon SQL Editor
. If you need help connecting, see
Connect from any client
.
Use your default Neon role or another role with
neon_superuser
privileges to create a developer role
on the parent branch
. For example, create a role named
dev_users
.
CREATE
ROLE
dev_users
PASSWORD
'<password>'
;
The password should have at least 12 characters with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters. For detailed password guidelines, see
Manage roles with SQL
.
Grant the
dev_users
role privileges on the database:
GRANT
ALL PRIVILEGES
ON
DATABASE
<database>
TO
dev_users;
You now have a
dev_users
role on your parent branch, and the role is not assigned to any users. This role will now be included in all future branches created from this branch.
note
The
GRANT
statement above does not grant privileges on existing schemas, tables, sequences, etc., within the database. If you want the
dev_users
role to access specific schemas, tables, etc., you need to grant those permissions explicitly.
For example, to grant all privileges on all tables in a schema:
GRANT
ALL PRIVILEGES
ON
ALL TABLES
IN
SCHEMA
<
schema_name
>
TO
dev_users;
Similarly, you'd grant privileges for sequences and other objects as needed.
That said, the
GRANT
command above allows users with the
dev_users
role to create new schemas within the database. But for pre-existing schemas and their objects, you need to grant permissions explicitly.
Create a development branch. Name it something like
dev1
. See
Create a branch
for instructions.
Connect to the database
on the development branch
with an SQL client. Be mindful that a child branch connection string differs from a parent branch connection string. The branches reside on different hosts. If you need help connecting to your branch, see
Connect from any client
.
After connecting the database on your new branch, create a developer user (e.g.,
dev_user1
). The password requirements described above apply here as well.
CREATE
ROLE
dev_user1
WITH
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'<password>'
;
Assign the
dev_users
role to the
dev_user1
user:
GRANT
dev_users
TO
dev_user1;
The
dev_user1
user can now connect to the database on your development branch and start using the database with full privileges.

;
-- Grant privileges to user
GRANT
dev_users
TO
dev_user1;
Revoke privileges
If you set up privilege-holding roles as describe above, you can revoke privileges by removing assigned roles. For example, to remove the
readwrite
role from
readwrite_user1
, run the following SQL statement:
REVOKE
readwrite
FROM
readwrite_user1;
Public schema privileges
When creating a new database, Postgres creates a schema named
public
in the database and permits access to the schema to a predefined Postgres role named
public
. Newly created roles in Postgres are automatically assigned the
public
role. In Postgres 14, the public role has
CREATE
and
USAGE
privileges on the
public
schema. In Postgres 15 and higher, the
public
role has only
USAGE
privileges on the
public
schema.
Why does this matter? If you create a new role and want to limit access for that role, you should be aware of the default
public
schema access automatically assigned to newly created roles.
If you want to limit access to the
public
schema for your users, you have to revoke privileges on the
public
schema explicitly.
For users of Postgres 14, the SQL statement to revoke the default
CREATE
permission on the
public
schema from the
public
role is as follows:
REVOKE
CREATE
ON
SCHEMA
public
FROM
PUBLIC;
You must be the owner of the
public
schema or a member of a role that authorizes you to execute this SQL statement.
To restrict the
public
role’s capability to connect to a database, use this statement:
REVOKE
ALL
ON
DATABASE
<database>
FROM
PUBLIC;
This ensures users are unable to connect to a database by default unless this permission is explicitly granted.
More information
For more information about granting privileges in Postgres, please see the
GRANT
command in the
PostgreSQL documentation
.

Manage databases
A database is a container for SQL objects such as schemas, tables, views, functions, and indexes. In the
Neon object hierarchy
, a database exists within a branch of a project. There is a limit of 500 databases per branch.
If you do not specify your own database name when creating a project, your project's default branch is created with a database called
neondb
, which is owned by your project's default role (see
Manage roles
for more information). You can create your own databases in a project's default branch or in a child branch.
All databases in Neon are created with a
public
schema. SQL objects are created in the
public
schema, by default. For more information about the
public
schema, refer to
The Public schema
, in the
PostgreSQL documentation
.
note
As of Postgres 15, only a database owner has the
CREATE
privilege on a database's
public
schema. For other users, the
CREATE
privilege must be granted manually via a
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;
statement. For more information, see
Public schema privileges
.
Databases belong to a branch. If you create a child branch, databases from the parent branch are copied to the child branch. For example, if database
mydb
exists in the parent branch, it will be copied to the child branch. The only time this does not occur is when you create a branch that includes data up to a particular point in time. If a database was created in the parent branch after that point in time, it is not duplicated in the child branch.
Neon supports creating and managing databases from the following interfaces:
Neon Console
Neon CLI
Neon API
SQL
Manage databases in the Neon Console
This section describes how to create, view, and delete databases in the Neon Console.
The role that creates a database is automatically made the owner of that database. The

.
Manage databases with the Neon API
Database actions performed in the Neon Console can also be also performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete databases using the Neon API. For other database-related methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
In Neon, a database belongs to a branch, which means that when you create a database, it is created in a branch. Database-related requests are therefore performed using branch API methods.
note
The API examples that follow may not show all user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all  attributes for a particular method, refer to the method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the cURL examples below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.

Manage databases with SQL
You can create and manage databases in Neon with SQL, as you can with any standalone Postgres installation. To create a database, issue a
CREATE DATABASE
statement from a client such as
psql
or from the
Neon SQL Editor
.
CREATE
DATABASE
testdb
;
Most standard
Postgres CREATE DATABASE parameters
are supported with the exception of
TABLESPACE
. This parameter requires access to the local file system, which is not permitted in Neon.
The role that creates a database is the owner of the database.
note
As of Postgres 15, only a database owner has the
CREATE
privilege on a database's
public
schema. For other users, the
CREATE
privilege on the
public
schema must be granted explicitly via a
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO <username>;
statement. For more information, see
Public schema privileges
.
For more information about database object privileges in Postgres, see
Privileges
.
Reserved database names
The following names are reserved and cannot be given to a database:

Manage computes
A compute is a virtualized service that runs applications. In Neon, a compute runs Postgres.
Each project has a primary read-write compute for its
default branch
. Neon supports both read-write and
read replica
computes. A branch can have one primary (read-write) compute and multiple read replica computes. A compute is required to connect to a Neon branch (where your database resides) from a client or application.
To connect to a database in a branch, you must use a compute associated with that branch. The following diagram illustrates how an application connects to a branch via its compute:
Project
|---- default branch (main) ---- compute <--- application/client
|    |
|    |---- database
|
---- child branch ---- compute <--- application/client
|
|---- database
Your Neon plan determines the resources (vCPUs and RAM) available to a compute. The
Neon Free Plan
supports computes with up to 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM. Paid plans offer larger compute sizes. Larger computes consume more compute hours over the same period of active time than smaller computes.
View a compute
A compute is associated with a branch. To view a compute, select
Branches
in the Neon Console, and select a branch. If the branch has a compute, it is shown on the
Computes
tab on the branch page.
Compute details shown on the
Computes
tab include:
The type of compute, which can be
Primary
(read-write) or
Read Replica
(read-only).
The compute status, typically
Active
or
Idle
.
Endpoint ID
: The compute endpoints ID, which always starts with an
ep-
prefix; for example:
ep-quiet-butterfly-w2qres1h
Size
: The size of the compute. Shows autoscaling minimum and maximum vCPU values if autoscaling is enabled.
Last active
: The date and time the compute was last active.
Edit
,
Monitor
, and
Connect
actions for a compute can be accessed from the
Computes
tab.
Create a compute
You can only create a single primary read-write compute for a branch that does not have a compute, but a branch can have multiple read replica computes.
To create an endpoint:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
On the
Computes
tab, click
Add a compute
or
Add Read Replica
if you already have a primary read-write compute.
On the
Add new compute
drawer or
Add read replica
drawer, specify your compute settings, and click
Add
. Selecting the
Read replica
compute type creates a
read replica
.
Edit a compute
You can edit a compute to change the
compute size
or
scale to zero
configuration.
To edit a compute:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
From the
Computes
tab, select
Edit
for the compute you want to edit.
The
Edit
drawer opens, letting you modify settings such as compute size, the autoscaling configuration (if applicable), and your scale to zero setting.
Once you've made your changes, click
Save
. All changes take immediate effect.
For information about selecting an appropriate compute size or autoscaling configuration, see
How to size your compute
.
What happens to the compute when making changes
Some key points to understand about how your endpoint responds when you make changes to your compute settings:
Changing the size of your fixed compute restarts the endpoint and
temporarily disconnects all existing connections
.
note
When your compute resizes automatically as part of the autoscaling feature, there are no restarts or disconnects; it just scales.
Editing minimum or maximum autoscaling sizes also requires a restart; existing connections are temporarily disconnected.
If you disable scale to zero, you may need to restart your compute manually to get the latest compute-related release updates from Neon if updates are not applied automatically by a
scheduled update
. Scheduled updates are applied according to certain criteria, so not all computes receive these updates automatically. See
Restart a compute
.
To avoid prolonged interruptions resulting from compute restarts, we recommend configuring your clients and applications to reconnect automatically in case of a dropped connection. See
Handling connection disruptions
.
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
You can change compute size settings when
editing a compute
.
Compute size
is the number of Compute Units (CUs) assigned to a Neon compute. The number of CUs determines the processing capacity of the compute. One CU has 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM, 2 CUs have 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM, and so on. The amount of RAM in GB is always 4 times the vCPUs, as shown in the table below.

Neon supports fixed-size and autoscaling compute configurations.
Fixed size:
Select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 56 CUs. A fixed-size compute does not scale to meet workload demand.
Autoscaling:
Specify a minimum and maximum compute size. Neon scales the compute size up and down within the selected compute size boundaries in response to the current load. Currently, the
Autoscaling
feature supports a range of 1/4 (.25) CU to 16 CUs. The 1/4 CU and 1/2 CU settings are
shared compute
. For information about how Neon implements the
Autoscaling
feature, see
Autoscaling
.
monitoring autoscaling
For information about monitoring your compute as it scales up and down, see
Monitor autoscaling
.
How to size your compute
The size of your compute determines the amount of frequently accessed data you can cache in memory and the maximum number of simultaneous connections you can support. As a result, if your compute size is too small, this can lead to suboptimal query performance and connection limit issues.
In Postgres, the
shared_buffers
setting defines the amount of data that can be held in memory. In Neon, the
shared_buffers
parameter
scales with compute size
and Neon also uses a Local File Cache (LFC) to extend the amount of memory available for caching data. The LFC can use up to 75% of your compute's RAM.
The Postgres
max_connections
setting defines your compute's maximum simultaneous connection limit and is set according to your compute size configuration.
The following table outlines the vCPU, RAM, LFC size (75% of RAM), and the
max_connections
limit for each compute size that Neon supports. To understand how
max_connections
is determined for an autoscaling configuration, see
Parameter settings that differ by compute size
.
note
Compute size support differs by
Neon plan
. Autoscaling is supported up to 16 CU. Neon supports fixed compute sizes (no autoscaling) for computes sizes larger than 16 CU.

When selecting a compute size, ideally, you want to keep as much of your dataset in memory as possible. This improves performance by reducing the amount of reads from storage. If your dataset is not too large, select a compute size that will hold the entire dataset in memory. For larger datasets that cannot be fully held in memory, select a compute size that can hold your
working set
. Selecting a compute size for a working set involves advanced steps, which are outlined below. See
Sizing your compute based on the working set
.
Regarding connection limits, you'll want a compute size that can support your anticipated maximum number of concurrent connections. If you are using
Autoscaling
, it is important to remember that your
max_connections
setting is based on both your minimum and the maximum compute size. See
Parameter settings that differ by compute size
for details. To avoid any
max_connections
constraints, you can use a pooled connection with your application, which supports up to 10,000 concurrent user connections. See
Connection pooling
.
Sizing your compute based on the working set
If it's not possible to hold your entire dataset in memory, the next best option is to ensure that your working set is in memory. A working set is your frequently accessed or recently used data and indexes. To determine whether your working set is fully in memory, you can query the cache hit ratio for your Neon compute. The cache hit ratio tells you how many queries are served from memory. Queries not served from memory bypass the cache to retrieve data from Neon storage (the
Pageserver
), which can affect query performance.
As mentioned above, Neon computes use a Local File Cache (LFC) to extend Postgres shared buffers. You can monitor the Local File Cache hit rate and your working set size from Neon's
Monitoring
page, where you'll find the following charts:
Local file cache hit rate
Working set size
Neon also provides a
neon
extension with a
neon_stat_file_cache
view that you can use to query the cache hit ratio for your compute's Local File Cache. For more information, see
The neon extension
.
Autoscaling considerations
Autoscaling is most effective when your data (either your full dataset or your working set) can be fully cached in memory on the minimum compute size in your autoscaling configuration.
Consider this scenario: If your data size is approximately 6 GB, starting with a compute size of .25 CU can lead to suboptimal performance because your data cannot be adequately cached. While your compute
will
scale up from .25 CU on demand, you may experience poor query performance until your compute scales up and fully caches your working set. You can avoid this issue if your minimum compute size can hold your working set in memory.
As mentioned above, your
max_connections
setting is based on both your minimum and maximum compute size settings. To avoid any
max_connections
constraints, you can use a pooled connection for your application. See
Connection pooling
.
Scale to zero configuration
Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature automatically transitions a compute into an idle state after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can disable scale to zero to maintain an "always-active" compute. An "always-active" configuration eliminates the few hundred milliseconds seconds of latency required to reactivate a compute but is likely to increase your compute time usage on systems where the database is not always active.
For more information, refer to
Configuring scale to zero for Neon computes
.
important
If you disable scale to zero, you may need to restart your compute manually to get the latest compute-related release updates from Neon if updates are not applied automatically by a
scheduled update
. Scheduled updates are applied according to certain criteria, so not all computes receive these updates automatically. See
Restart a compute
.
Restart a compute
It is sometimes necessary to restart a compute. Reasons for restarting a compute might include:
Applying upgraded limits after upgrading to a paid plan
Picking up the latest compute-related updates, which Neon typically releases weekly
Picking up a new Postgres extension or extension version released by Neon
Resolving performance issues or unexpected behavior
Restarting ensures your compute is running with the latest configurations and improvements.
important
Restarting a compute interrupts any connections currently using the compute. To avoid prolonged interruptions resulting from compute restarts, we recommend configuring your clients and applications to reconnect automatically in case of a dropped connection.
You can restart a compute using one of the following methods:
Issue a
Restart compute endpoint
call using the Neon API. You can do this directly from the Neon API Reference using the
Try It!
feature or via the command line with a cURL command similar to the one shown below. You'll need your
project ID
, compute
endpoint ID
, and an
API key
.
curl
--request
POST
\
--url
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/cool-forest-86753099/endpoints/ep-calm-flower-a5b75h79/restart
\
--header
'accept: application/json'
\
--header
'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
note
The
Restart compute endpoint
API only works on an active compute. If you're compute is idle, you can wake it up with a query or the
Start compute endpoint
API.
Stop activity on your compute (stop running queries) and wait for your compute to suspend due to inactivity. By default, Neon suspends a compute after 5 minutes of inactivity. You can watch the status of your compute on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console. Select your branch and monitor your compute's
Status
field. Wait for it to report an
Idle
status. The compute will restart the next time it's accessed, and the status will change to
Active
.
Delete a compute
A branch can have a single read-write compute and multiple read replica computes. You can delete any of these computes from a branch. However, be aware that a compute is required to connect to a branch and access its data. If you delete a compute and add it back later, the new compute will have different connection details.
To delete a compute:
In the Neon Console, select
Branches
.
Select a branch.
On the
Computes
tab, click
Edit
for the compute you want to delete.
At the bottom of the
Edit compute
drawer, click
Delete compute
.
Manage computes with the Neon API
Compute actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the
Neon API
. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, update, and delete computes using the Neon API. For other compute-related API methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
note
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the cURL examples below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.
note
To learn more about the types of API keys you can create — personal, organization, or project-scoped — see
Manage API Keys
.

Compute-related issues
This section outlines compute-related issues you may encounter and possible resolutions.
No space left on device
You may encounter an error similar to the following when your compute's local disk storage is full:
ERROR:
could
not
write
to
file
"base/pgsql_tmp/pgsql_tmp1234.56.fileset/o12of34.p1.0"
:
No
space
left
on
device
(SQLSTATE
53100
)
Neon computes allocate 20 GiB of local disk space or 15 GiB x the maximum compute size (whichever is highest) for temporary files used by Postgres. Data-intensive operations can sometimes consume all of this space, resulting in
No space left on device
errors.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following strategies:
Identify and terminate resource-intensive processes
: These could be long-running queries, operations, or possibly sync or replication activities. You can start your investigation by
listing running queries by duration
.
Optimize queries to reduce temporary file usage
.
Adjust pipeline settings for third-party sync or replication
: If you're syncing or replicating data with an external service, modify the pipeline settings to control disk space usage.
If the issue persists, refer to our
Neon Support channels
.
Compute is not suspending
In some cases, you may observe that your compute remains constantly active for no apparent reason. Possible causes for a constantly active compute when not expected include:
Connection requests
: Frequent connection requests from clients, applications, or integrations can prevent a compute from suspending automatically. Each connection resets the scale to zero timer.
Background processes
: Some applications or background jobs may run periodic tasks that keep the connection active.
Possible steps you can take to identify the issues include:
Checking for active processes
You can run the following query to identify active sessions and their states:
SELECT
pid,
usename,
query,
state
,
query_start
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE
query_start
>=
now
()
-
interval
'24 hours'
ORDER BY
query_start
DESC
;
Look for processes initiated by your users, applications, or integrations that may be keeping your compute active.
Review connection patterns
Ensure that no applications are sending frequent, unnecessary connection requests.
Consider batching connections if possible, or use
connection pooling
to limit persistent connections.
Optimize any background jobs
If background jobs are needed, reduce their frequency or adjust their timing to allow Neon's scale to zero feature to activate after the defined period of inactivity (the default is 5 minutes). For more information, refer to our
Scale to zero guide
.

Maintenance & updates overview
new
Neon performs two types of updates:
platform maintenance
and
updates
to your Neon
computes
. While both are essential for maintaining a stable, secure, and optimized environment, they serve different purposes.
Platform maintenance
includes updates to Neon's infrastructure, resource management operations, and critical security patches. These changes ensure platform stability and security. To learn more, see
Platform maintenance
.
Updates
apply improvements and updates to individual Neon computes, including Postgres updates, operating system patches, and new Neon features. These updates keep your Neon compute environment and Postgres instances current and optimized. To learn more, see
Updates
.
For both types of updates, we strive to minimize disruption to database operations and provide advanced notification. The table below outlines where you can check for upcoming maintenance and updates.

System operations
An operation is an action performed by the Neon Control Plane on a Neon object or resource. Operations are typically initiated by user actions, such as creating a branch or deleting a database. Other operations may be initiated by the Neon Control Plane, such as suspending a
compute
after a period of inactivity or checking its availability. You can monitor operations to keep an eye on the overall health of your Neon project or to check the status of specific operations. When working with the Neon API, you can poll the status of operations to ensure that an API request is completed before issuing the next API request. For more information, see
Poll operation status
.
Operation
Description
Apply config
Applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, changing compute settings or creating, deleting, or updating Postgres users and databases initiates this operation.
Apply storage config
Applies a new configuration to a Neon storage object or resource. For example, updating the restore window for a project initiates this operation.
Check availability
Checks the availability of data in a branch and that a
compute
can start on a branch. Branches without a compute are not checked. This operation, performed by the
availability checker
, is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane.
Create branch
Creates a
branch
in a Neon project. For related information, see

Operations and the Neon API
This section describes how to work with operations using the
Neon API
. The following topics are covered:
List operations
: Describes how to list all operations for a Neon project.
List operations with pagination
: Describes how to list all operations for a Neon project and paginate the response.
Get operation
: Describes how to retrieve the details for a specific operation by the operation ID.
Poll operation status
: Describes how to poll an operation for its status, which may be necessary to avoid failed requests due to in-progress operations when using the Neon API programmatically.
note
Operation names have underscores when view using the API; for example:

List operations with pagination
Pagination allows you to limit the number of operations displayed, as the number of operations for a project can be large. To paginate responses, issue an initial request with a
limit
value. For brevity, the limit is set to 1 in the following example.
cURL command:

Poll operation status
Some Neon API requests may take a few moments to complete. When using the Neon API programmatically, you can check the
status
of an operation before proceeding with the next API request. For example, you may want to check the operation status of a create branch request before issuing a create database request for that branch.
The response to a Neon API request includes information about the operations that were initiated. For example, a create branch request initiates
create_branch
and
start_compute
operations.
"operations"

{
"id"

}
]
You can use the
Get operation details
method to poll the status of an operation by the operation ID. You might do this at intervals of 5 seconds until the
status
of the operation changes to
finished
before issuing the next request. For example, this request polls the
start_compute
operation shown above:
curl
'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/autumn-disk-484331/operations/055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8'
\
-H
'Accept: application/json'
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY"
Response body
{
"operation"
:
{
"id"
:
"055b17e6-ffe3-47ab-b545-cfd7db6fd8b8"
,
"project_id"
:
"autumn-disk-484331"
,
"branch_id"
:
"br-dawn-scene-747675"
,
"endpoint_id"
:
"ep-small-bush-675287"
,

,
"updated_at"
:
"2022-12-08T19:55:43Z"
}
}
Possible operation
status
values include:
scheduling
,
running
,
finished
,
failed
,
cancelling
,
cancelled
, and
skipped
. Only
finished
,
skipped
, and
cancelled
are
terminal statuses
, meaning the operation will not proceed further from these states. Note that
failed
is
not
terminal, as an operation in a
failed
state can still be retried.

Organizations
Manage your projects and collaborate with team members
In Neon, all projects live within organizations. When you sign up, you automatically get a free organization for your first project. Organizations provide a central place to manage your projects, collaborate with team members, and — for paid plans — handle your billing.
About Neon Organizations
In the Neon Console, the Organizations page gives you a centralized view of all your projects. From there, you can create new projects, manage existing ones, and oversee your members, billing information, and access to preview features through the
Early Access Program
.
User roles and permissions
Organizations have two main member roles:
Admin
— Full control over the organization and all its projects.
Member
— Access to all organization projects, but cannot modify org settings or delete projects.
For a full breakdown of what each role can do, see the
User Permissions
page.
Creating a new organization
You can create additional organizations at any time.
See how to create an organization.
Limitations
As we continue to refine our organization features, here are some temporary limitations you should be aware of:
Branch management
— All users are currently able to manage
protected branches
, regardless of their role or permission level. Granular permissions for this feature are not yet implemented.
Permissions and roles
— The current permissions system may not meet all needs for granular control. Users are encouraged to share their feedback and requirements for more detailed permissions settings.
Feedback
If you've got feature requests or feedback about what you'd like to see from Organizations in Neon, let us know via the
Feedback
form in the Neon Console or our
feedback channel
on Discord.

Manage organizations using the Neon API
Learn how to manage Neon Organizations using the Neon API, including managing organization API keys, working with organization members, and handling member invitations.
Personal vs organization API keys
You can authorize your API requests using either of these methods:
Organization API key
: Automatically scopes all requests to your organization
Personal API key
: Requires including an
org_id
parameter to specify which organization you're working with
The key difference is in how you structure your API requests. Here's an example of listing projects using both methods:
Using an organization API key:
curl
--request
GET
\
--url
'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects'
\
--header
'authorization: Bearer $ORG_API_KEY'
Using a personal API key:
curl
--request
GET
\
--url
'https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects?org_id=org-example-12345678'
\
--header
'authorization: Bearer $PERSONAL_API_KEY'
Both examples retrieve a list of projects, but notice how the personal API key request includes
org_id=org-example-12345678
to specify which organization's projects to list. With an organization API key, this parameter isn't needed because the key itself is already tied to a specific organization.
Matrix of operations and key types

Finding your org_id
To find your organization's
org_id
, navigate to your Organization's
Settings
page, where you'll find it under the
General information
section. Copy and use this ID in your API requests.
Create API keys
There are two types of organization API keys:
Organization API keys
— Provide admin-level access to all organization resources, including projects, members, and settings. Only organization admins can create these keys.
Project-scoped organization API keys
— Provide limited, member-level access to specific projects within the organization. Any organization member can create a key for any organization-owned project.
The key token is only displayed once at creation time. Copy it immediately and store it securely. If lost, you’ll need to revoke the key and create a new one. For detailed instructions, see
Manage API Keys
.

List API keys
Lists all API keys for your organization. The response does not include the actual key tokens, as these are only provided when creating a new key.

Overview of the Neon object hierarchy
Managing your Neon environment requires an understanding of the Neon object hierarchy. At the top level, an
Organization
contains one or more
Projects
. Each Project contains
Branches
, which in turn contain
Computes
,
Roles
, and
Databases
. The diagram below illustrates this hierarchy.
Neon account
Your Neon account represents your user profile and is used for authentication, personal settings, and managing personal API keys. You can sign up for a Neon account with an email, GitHub, Google, or partner account. A single Neon account can belong to multiple organizations.
API keys
can be personal (global to your account) or scoped to an organization or project. For more details, see
Manage API keys
.
Organizations
Organizations are the top-level containers for projects and resources in Neon. They allow you to organize and manage a team's projects under a single Neon account — with billing, role management, and project transfer capabilities all in one accessible location in the Neon Console.
Projects
A project is a container for all objects except for API keys, which are global and work with any project owned by your Neon account. Branches, computes, roles, and databases belong to a project. A Neon project also defines the region where project resources reside. A Neon account can have multiple projects, but plan limits define the number of projects per Neon account. For more information, see
Manage projects
.
Default branch
Data resides in a branch. Each Neon project is created with a default branch called
main
. This initial branch is also your project's root branch, which cannot be deleted. After creating more branches, you can designate a different branch as your default branch, but your root branch cannot be deleted. You can create child branches from any branch in your project. Each branch can contain multiple databases and roles. Plan limits define the number of branches you can create in a project and the amount of data per branch. To learn more, see
Manage branches
.
R/W computes and Read Replicas
A compute is a virtualized computing resource that includes vCPU and memory for running applications. In the context of Neon, a compute runs Postgres. When you create a project in Neon, a primary R/W (read/write) compute is created for a project's default branch. Neon supports both R/W and
Read Replica
computes. A branch can have a single primary R/W compute but supports multiple Read Replica computes. To connect to a database that resides on a branch, you must connect via a R/W or Read Replica compute associated with the branch. Your Neon plan defines the resources (vCPU and RAM) available to your R/W and Read Replica computes. For more information, see
Manage computes
. Compute size, autoscaling, and scale to zero are all settings that are configured for R/W and Read Replica computes.
Roles
In Neon, roles are Postgres roles. A role is required to create and access a database. A role belongs to a branch. There is a limit of 500 roles per branch. The default branch of a Neon project is created with a role named for your database. For example, if your database is named
neondb
, the project is created with a role named
neondb_owner
. This role is the owner of the database. Any role created via the Neon Console, CLI, or API is created with
neon_superuser
privileges. For more information, see
Manage roles
.
Databases
As with any standalone instance of Postgres, a database is a container for SQL objects such as schemas, tables, views, functions, and indexes. In Neon, a database belongs to a branch. If you do not specify your own database name when creating a project, the default branch of your project is created with a ready-to-use database named
neondb
. There is a limit of 500 databases per branch. For more information, see
Manage databases
.
Schemas
All databases in Neon are created with a
public
schema, which is the default behavior for any standard PostgreSQL instance. SQL objects are created in the
public
schema, by default. For more information about the
public
schema, refer to
The Public schema
, in the
PostgreSQL documentation
.

Platform maintenance
new
Neon occasionally performs essential
platform maintenance
outside of
scheduled updates
performed on Neon computes. This means that you may experience brief disruptions from time to time for these important updates.
Platform maintenance may include any of the following:
Neon infrastructure updates and upgrades (e.g., updates to Neon Kubernetes clusters or compute nodes)
Resource management updates (e.g., rebalancing of compute nodes)
Critical security patches (e.g., addressing a zero-day vulnerability)
We strive to avoid disruptions as much as possible, but certain updates may require compute restarts or result in temporary latency for operations like compute starts, queries, or API requests.
note
Whenever possible, we perform platform maintenance outside of normal business hours in affected regions to minimize disruption.
Where to check for maintenance
For notification of planned platform maintenance, you can monitor or subscribe to the
Neon Status page
for your region. To learn more, see
Neon Status
.
If there is ongoing maintenance, you'll see a
Maintenance
indicator at the top of the Neon Console. Clicking on the indicator takes you to the Neon Status page where you can read the maintenance notification.
Handling disruptions and latency during platform maintenance
Most Postgres connection drivers include built-in retry mechanisms that automatically handle short-lived interruptions. This means that most applications are able to transparently reconnect to a Neon database following a brief disruption.
However, if your application has strict availability requirements, you may want to ensure that your connection settings are configured to allow for connection retries. Check your driver's documentation for options like connection timeouts, retry intervals, and connection pooling strategies. Your configuration should account for occasional disruptions. For related information, see
Build connection timeout handling into your application
.
If your application or integration uses the
Neon API
or
SDKs
that wrap the Neon API, we recommend building in the same type of retry logic.

Manage projects
Learn how to manage Neon projects from the Neon Console or the Neon API.
In Neon, the project is your main workspace. Within a project, you create branches for different workflows, like environments, features, or previews. Each branch contains its own databases, roles, computes, and replicas. Your
Neon Plan
determines how many projects you can create and the resource limits within those projects.
Default resources
When you add a new project, Neon creates the following resources by default:
Two branches are created for you by default:
production
(your main branch for production workloads) and
development
(a child branch for development work). You can create additional child branches from either of these, or from any other branch. For more information, see
Manage branches
.
A single primary read-write compute. This is the compute associated with the branch. For more information, see
Manage computes
.
A Postgres database that resides on the project's default branch. If you did not specify your own database name when creating the project, the database created is named
neondb
.
A Postgres role that is named for your database. For example, if your database is named
neondb
, the project is created with a default role named
neondb_owner
.
Each
Neon plan
comes with a specific storage allowance. Beyond this allowance on paid plans, extra usage costs apply. Billing-related allowances aside, Neon projects can support data sizes up to 4 TiB. To increase this limit,
contact the Neon Sales team
.
Create a project
The following instructions describe how to create additional Neon projects. If you are creating your very first Neon project, refer to the instructions in
Playing with Neon
.
To create a Neon project:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Click
New Project
.
Specify values for
Project Name
,
Postgres version
,
Cloud Service Provider
, and
Region
. Project names are limited to 64 characters. You can also specify
Compute size
settings when creating a project. The settings you specify become the default settings for computes that you add to your project when creating
branches
or
read replicas
.
Neon supports fixed-size computes and autoscaling. For more information, see
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
.
The scale to zero setting determines whether a compute is automatically suspended after a period of inactivity. For more information, see
Scale to zero configuration
.
Click
Create Project
.
After creating a project, you are directed to the Neon Quickstart.
tip
Similar to
docs.new
for instantly creating Google Docs or
repo.new
for adding new GitHub repositories, you can use
pg.new
to create a new Neon Postgres project. Simply visit
pg.new
and you'll be taken directly to the
Create project
page where you can create your new project.
View projects
To view your projects:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
From the breadcrumb navigation menu at the top-left of the console, select your organization.
The
Projects
page lists your projects, including any projects that have been shared with you.
Project settings
Once you open a project, you can use the
Settings
page to manage your project and configure any defaults.
The
Settings
page includes these sub-pages:
General
— Change the name of your project or copy the project ID.
Compute
— Set the scale to zero and sizing defaults for any new computes you create when branching.
Storage
— Choose how long Neon maintains a history of changes for all branches.
Updates
— Schedule a time for Postgres and Neon updates
Collaborators
— Let other users access your project's databases.
Network Security
— Configure Neon's IP and Private Networking features for secure access.
Logical Replication
— Enable logical replication to replicate data from your Neon project to external data services and platforms.
Transfer
— Transfer your project from the current organization to another organization you are a member of.
Delete
— Use with care! This action deletes your entire project and all its objects, and is irreversible.
General project settings
On the
General
page, you are permitted to change the name of your project or copy the project ID. The project ID is permanent and cannot be changed.
Change your project's default compute settings
You can change your project's default compute settings on the
Compute
page. These settings determine the compute resources allocated to any new branches or read replicas you create.
important
Changes to default compute settings only affect
newly created computes
. Existing computes, including those on your primary branch and read replicas, will not be automatically updated. To change settings for existing computes, you need to update them individually through the
Branches
page.
A Compute Unit (CU) represents 1 vCPU with 4 GB of RAM. New branches inherit compute settings from your first branch, but you can change these defaults to:
Set smaller compute sizes for preview deployments and development branches
Standardize settings across read replicas
Optimize resource usage and costs for non-production workloads
Neon supports two compute configurations:
Fixed size:
Select a fixed compute size ranging from .25 CUs to 56 CUs
Autoscaling:
Specify minimum and maximum compute sizes (from .25 CU to 16 CUs) to automatically scale based on workload. Note: When setting maximum above 10 CUs, the minimum must be at least max/8. For more information, see
Autoscaling
Configure your restore window
By default, Neon retains a history of changes for all branches in your project, enabling features like:
Instant restore
for recovering lost data
Time Travel
queries for investigating data issues
The default retention window is
1 day
across all plans to help avoid unexpected storage costs. If you extend this restore window, you'll expand the range of data recovery and query options, but note that this will also increase your
storage
usage, especially with multiple active branches.
Also note that adjusting the restore window affects
all
branches in your project.
To configure the restore window for a project:
Select a project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Storage
.
Use the slider to select the restore window.
Click
Save
.
For more information about available plan limits, see
Neon plans
.
note
The Storage page also outlines Neon
Archive storage
** policy, if applicable to your Neon plan. For more information on this topic, see
Branch archiving
.
Schedule updates for your project
To keep your Neon computes and Postgres instances up to date, Neon automatically applies scheduled updates that include Postgres minor version upgrades, security patches, and new features. Updates are applied to the computes within your project. They require a quick compute restart, take only a few seconds, and typically occur weekly.
On the Free Plan, updates are automatically scheduled. On paid plans, you can set a preferred day and time for updates. Restarts occur within your selected time window and take only a few seconds.
To set your update schedule or view currently scheduled updates:
Go to
Settings
>
Updates
.
Choose a day of the week and an hour. Updates will occur within this time window and take only a few seconds.
For more information, see
Updates
.
Invite collaborators to a project
Neon's project collaboration feature allows you to invite external Neon accounts to collaborate on a Neon project.
note
Organization members cannot be added as collaborators to organization-owned projects since they already have access to all projects through their organization membership.
To invite collaborators to a Neon project:
In the Neon Console, select a project.
Select
Project settings
.
Select
Collaborators
.
Select
Invite
and enter the email address of the account you want to collaborate with.
Click
Invite
.
The email you specify is added to the list of
Collaborators
. The Neon account associated with that email address is granted full access to the project, with the exception of privileges required to delete the project. This account can also invite other Neon users to the project. When that user logs in to Neon, the project they were invited to is listed on their
Projects
page under
Shared with you
.
The costs associated with projects being collaborated on are charged to the Neon account that owns the project. For example, if you invite another Neon user account to a project you own, any usage incurred by that user within your project is billed to your Neon account, not theirs.
For additional information, refer to our
Project collaboration guide
.
Configure IP Allow
Available to Neon
Scale
and
Business
plan users, the IP Allow feature provides an added layer of security for your data, restricting access to the branch where your database resides to only those IP addresses that you specify. In Neon, the IP allowlist is applied to all branches by default.
Optionally, you can allow unrestricted access to your project's
non-default branches
. For instance, you might want to restrict access to the default branch to a handful of trusted IPs while allowing unrestricted access to your development branches.
By default, Neon allows IP addresses from
0.0.0.0
, which means that Neon accepts connections from any IP address. Once you configure IP Allow by adding IP addresses or ranges, only those IP addresses will be allowed to access Neon.
note
Neon projects provisioned on AWS support both
IPv4
and
IPv6
addresses. Neon project provisioned on Azure currently on support IPv4.
Neon Console
CLI
API
To configure an allowlist:
Select a project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Network Security
.
Under
IP Allow
, specify the IP addresses you want to permit. Separate multiple entries with commas.
Optionally, select
Restrict IP Access to protected branches only
to restrict access to only the branches you have designated as protected.
Click
Save changes
.
How to specify IP addresses
You can define an allowlist with individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or
CIDR notation
. A combination of these options is also permitted. Multiple entries, whether they are the same or of different types, must be separated by a comma. Whitespace is ignored.
Add individual IP addresses
: You can add individual IP addresses that you want to allow. This is useful for granting access to specific users or devices. This example represents a single IP address:
192.0.2.1
Define IP ranges
: For broader access control, you can define IP ranges. This is useful for allowing access from a company network or a range of known IPs. This example range includes all IP addresses from
198.51.100.20
to
198.51.100.50
:
198.51.100.20-198.51.100.50
Use CIDR notation
: For more advanced control, you can use
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation
. This is a compact way of defining a range of IPs and is useful for larger networks or subnets. Using CIDR notation can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network.
This CIDR notation example represents all 256 IP addresses from
203.0.113.0
to
203.0.113.255
.
203.0.113.0/24
Use IPv6 addresses
: Neon projects provisioned on AWS also support specifying IPv6 addresses. For example:
note
IPv6 is not yet supported for projects provisioned on Azure.
2001:DB8:5432::/48
A combined example using all three options above, specified as a comma-separated list, would appear similar to the following:
192.0.2.1, 198.51.100.20-198.51.100.50, 203.0.113.0/24, 2001:DB8:5432::/48
This list combines individual IP addresses, a range of IP addresses, a CIDR block, and an IPv6 address. It illustrates how different types of IP specifications can be used together in a single allowlist configuration, offering a flexible approach to access control.
Update an IP Allow configuration
You can update your IP Allow configuration via the Neon Console or API as described in
Configure IP Allow
. Replace the current configuration with the new configuration. For example, if your IP Allow configuration currently allows access from IP address
192.0.2.1
, and you want to extend access to IP address
192.0.2.2
, specify both addresses in your new configuration:
192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2
. You cannot append values to an existing configuration. You can only replace an existing configuration with a new one.
The Neon CLI provides an
ip-allow
command with
add
,
reset
, and
remove
options that you can use to update your IP Allow configuration. For instructions, refer to
Neon CLI commands — ip-allow
.
Remove an IP Allow configuration
To remove an IP configuration entirely to go back to the default "no IP restrictions" (
0.0.0.0
) configuration:
Neon Console
CLI
API
Select a project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
IP Allow
.
Clear the
Allowed IP addresses and ranges
field.
If applicable, clear the
Apply to default branch only
checkbox.
Click
Apply changes
.
Enable logical replication
Logical replication enables replicating data from your Neon databases to a variety of external destinations, including data warehouses, analytical database services, messaging platforms, event-streaming platforms, and external Postgres databases.
important
Enabling logical replication modifies the PostgreSQL
wal_level
configuration parameter, changing it from
replica
to
logical
for all databases in your Neon project. Once the
wal_level
setting is changed to
logical
, it cannot be reverted. Enabling logical replication also restarts all computes in your Neon project, meaning that active connections will be dropped and have to reconnect.
To enable logical replication in Neon:
Select your project in the Neon Console.
On the Neon
Dashboard
, select
Settings
.
Select
Logical Replication
.
Click
Enable
to enable logical replication.
You can verify that logical replication is enabled by running the following query:
SHOW wal_level;
wal_level
-----------
logical
After enabling logical replication, the next steps involve creating publications on your replication source database in Neon and configuring subscriptions on the destination system or service. To get started, refer to our
logical replication guides
.
Delete a project
Deleting a project is a permanent action, which also deletes any computes, branches, databases, and roles that belong to the project.
To delete a project:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select the project that you want to delete.
Select
Project settings
.
Select
Delete
.
Click
Delete project.
On the confirmation dialog, click
Delete
.
important
If you are any of Neon's paid plans, such as our Launch or Scale plan, deleting all your Neon projects won't stop monthly billing. To avoid charges, you also need to downgrade to the Free plan. You can do so from the
Billing
page in the Neon Console.
Manage projects with the Neon API
Project actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using the Neon API. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, and delete projects using the Neon API. For other project-related API methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
note
The API examples that follow may not show all of the user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the cURL examples shown below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.
note
To learn more about the types of API keys you can create — personal, organization, or project-scoped — see
Manage API Keys
.
Create a project with the API
The following Neon API method creates a project. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the
Neon API reference
.

Manage roles
In Neon, roles are Postgres roles. Each Neon project is created with a Postgres role that is named for your database. For example, if your database is named
neondb
, the project is created with a role named
neondb_owner
. This role owns the database that is created in your Neon project's default branch.
Your Postgres role and roles created in the Neon Console, API, and CLI are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role. Roles created with SQL from clients like
psql
,
pgAdmin
, or the
Neon SQL Editor
are only granted the basic
public schema privileges
granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see
Manage database access
.
note
Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres
superuser
account like you can in a standalone Postgres installation.
You can create roles in a project's default branch or child branches. While there is no strict limit on the number of roles you can create, we recommend keeping it under 500 per branch.
In Neon, roles belong to a branch, which could be your production branch or a child branch. When you create a child branch, roles in the parent branch are duplicated in the child branch. For example, if role
alex
exists in the parent branch, role
alex
is copied to the child branch when the child branch is created. The only time this does not occur is when you create a branch that only includes data up to a particular point in time. If the role was created in the parent branch after that point in time, it is not duplicated in the child branch.
Neon supports creating and managing roles from the following interfaces:
Neon Console
Neon CLI
Neon API
SQL
The neon_superuser role
Roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, or API, including the role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role. Users cannot login as
neon_superuser
, but they inherit the privileges assigned to this role. The privileges and predefined role memberships granted to
neon_superuser
include:
CREATEDB
: Provides the ability to create databases.
CREATEROLE
: Provides the ability to create new roles (which also means it can alter and drop roles).
BYPASSRLS
: Provides the ability to bypass row-level security (RLS) policies. This attribute is only included in
neon_superuser
roles in projects created after the
August 15, 2023 release
.
NOLOGIN
: The role cannot be used to log in to the Postgres server. Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system directly.
pg_read_all_data
: A predefined Postgres role provides the ability to read all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having
SELECT
rights on those objects, and
USAGE
rights on all schemas.
pg_write_all_data
: A predefined Postgres role that provides the ability to write all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having
INSERT
,
UPDATE
, and
DELETE
rights on those objects, and
USAGE
rights on all schemas.
REPLICATION
: Provides the ability to connect to a Postgres server in replication mode and create or drop replication slots.
pg_create_subscription
: A predefined Postgres role that lets users with
CREATE
permission on the database issue
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
. The
pg_create_subscription
role is only available as of Postgres 16. The
neon_superuser
role in Postgres 14 and 15 can issue
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION
with only
CREATE
permission on the database.
pg_monitor
: A predefined Postgres role that provides read/execute privileges on various Postgres monitoring views and functions. The
neon_superuser
role also has
WITH ADMIN
on the
pg_monitor
role, which enables granting the
pg_monitor
to other Postgres roles.
EXECUTE
privilege on the
pg_stat_statements_reset()
function that is part of the
pg_stat_statements
extension. This privilege was introduced with the January 12, 2024 release. If you installed the
pg_stat_statements
extension before this release, drop and recreate the
pg_stat_statements
extension to enable this privilege. See
Install an extension
.
GRANT ALL ON TABLES
and
WITH GRANT OPTION
on the
public
schema.
GRANT ALL ON SEQUENCES
and
WITH GRANT OPTION
on the
public
schema.
You can think of roles with
neon_superuser
privileges as administrator roles. If you require roles with limited privileges, such as a read-only role, you can create those roles from an SQL client. For more information, see
Manage database access
.
note
Creating a database with the
neon_superuser
role, altering a database to have owner
neon_superuser
, and altering the
neon_superuser role
itself are
not
permitted. This
NOLOGIN
role is not intended to be used directly or modified.
Manage roles in the Neon Console
This section describes how to create, view, and delete roles in the Neon Console. All roles created in the Neon Console are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role.
Create a role
To create a role:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select a project.
Select
Branches
.
Select the branch where you want to create the role.
On the
Roles & Databases
tab, click
Add role
.
In the role creation modal, specify a role name. The branch is pre-selected.
Click
Create
. The role is created and you are provided with the password for the role.
note
Role names cannot exceed 63 characters, and some names are not permitted. See
Reserved role names
.
Delete a role
Deleting a role is a permanent action that cannot be undone, and you cannot delete a role that owns a database. The database must be deleted before deleting the role that owns the database.
To delete a role:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select a project.
Select
Branches
.
Select the branch where you want to delete a role.
On the
Roles & Databases
tab, select
Delete role
from the role menu.
On the confirmation modal, click
Delete
.
Reset a password
To reset a role's password:
Navigate to the
Neon Console
.
Select a project.
Select
Branches
.
Select the role's branch.
On the
Roles & Databases
tab, select
Reset password
from the role menu.
On the
Reset password
modal, click
Reset
. A reset password modal is displayed with your new password.
note
Resetting a password in the Neon Console resets the password to a generated value. To set your own password value, you can reset the password using the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client like
psql
with the following syntax:
ALTER
USER
user_name
WITH
PASSWORD
'new_password'
;
For password requirements, see
Manage roles with SQL
.
Manage roles with the Neon CLI
The Neon CLI supports creating and deleting roles. For instructions, see
Neon CLI commands — roles
. Roles created with the Neon CLI are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role.
Manage roles with the Neon API
Role actions performed in the Neon Console can also be performed using Neon API role methods. The following examples demonstrate how to create, view, reset passwords for, and delete roles using the Neon API. For other role-related methods, refer to the
Neon API reference
.
Roles created with the Neon API are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role.
In Neon, roles belong to branches, which means that when you create a role, it is created in a branch. Role-related requests are therefore performed using branch API methods.
note
The API examples that follow may not show all user-configurable request body attributes that are available to you. To view all  attributes for a particular method, refer to method's request body schema in the
Neon API reference
.
The
jq
option specified in each example is an optional third-party tool that formats the
JSON
response, making it easier to read. For information about this utility, see
jq
.
Prerequisites
A Neon API request requires an API key. For information about obtaining an API key, see
Create an API key
. In the cURL examples shown below,
$NEON_API_KEY
is specified in place of an actual API key, which you must provide when making a Neon API request.
note
To learn more about the types of API keys you can create — personal, organization, or project-scoped — see
Manage API Keys
.
Create a role with the API
The following Neon API method creates a role. To view the API documentation for this method, refer to the

Manage roles with SQL
Roles created with SQL have the same basic
public
schema privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role like roles created with the Neon Console, CLI, or API. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have.
To create a role with SQL, issue a
CREATE ROLE
statement from a client such as
psql
,
pgAdmin
, or the
Neon SQL Editor
.
CREATE
ROLE
<name>
WITH
LOGIN
PASSWORD
'password'
;
WITH LOGIN
means that the role will have a login privilege, required for the role to log in to your Neon Postgres instance. If the role is used only for privilege management, the
WITH LOGIN
privilege is unnecessary.
A password must have a minimum entropy of 60 bits.
info
To create a password with 60 bits of entropy, you can follow these password composition guidelines:
Length
: The password should consist of at least 12 characters.
Character diversity
: To enhance complexity, passwords should include a variety of character types, specifically:
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
Avoid predictability
: To maintain a high level of unpredictability, do not use:
Sequential patterns (such as '1234', 'abcd', 'qwerty')
Common words or phrases
Any words found in a dictionary
Avoid character repetition
: To maximize randomness, do not use the same character more than twice consecutively.
Example password:
T3sting!23Ab
(DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE PASSWORD)
Passwords must be supplied in plain text but are encrypted when stored. Hashed passwords are not supported.
The guidelines should help you create a password with approximately 60 bits of entropy. However, depending on the exact characters used, the actual entropy might vary slightly. Always aim for a longer and more complex password if you're uncertain. It's also recommended to use a trusted password manager to create and store your complex passwords safely.
Neon also supports the
NOLOGIN
option:
CREATE ROLE role_name NOLOGIN;
This allows you to define roles that cannot authenticate but can be granted privileges.
For role creation and access management examples, refer to the
Manage database access
guide.
Creating NOLOGIN roles
Neon supports creating Postgres roles with the
NOLOGIN
attribute. This allows you to define roles that cannot authenticate but can be granted privileges.
CREATE
ROLE
my_role NOLOGIN;
Roles with
NOLOGIN
are commonly used for permission management.
The Neon API and CLI also support creating
NOLOGIN
roles:
The Neon API
Create role
endpoint supports a
no_login
attribute.
The Neon CLI
neon roles create
command supports a
--no-login
option.
Reserved role names
The following names are reserved and cannot be given to a role:
Any name starting with
pg_
neon_superuser
cloud_admin
zenith_admin
public
none

Updates
new
To keep your Neon
computes
and Postgres instances up to date with the latest patches and features, Neon applies updates to your project's computes. We notify you of updates in advance so that you can plan for them if necessary. On Neon's paid plans, you can select an update window — a specific day and hour for updates.
Neon briefly restarts a compute to apply an update. The entire process takes just a few seconds, minimizing any potential disruption.
What updates are included?
Updates to Neon computes may include some or all of the following:
Postgres minor version upgrades, typically released quarterly
Security patches and updates
Operating system updates
Neon features and enhancements
Updates to other tools and components included in Neon compute images
Neon compute updates do not include
Neon platform maintenance
.
How often are updates applied?
Updates are typically released weekly but may occur more or less frequently, as needed.
Neon applies updates to computes based on the following rules:
Computes that have been active for 30 days or more receive updates.
Computes that are restarted receive available updates immediately.
Computes in a transition state (e.g., shutting down or restarting) at the time of an update are not updated.
Computes larger than 8 CU or that can scale past 8 CU are not updated automatically. See
Updating large computes
.
If a compute is excluded from an update, Neon will apply the missed update with the next update, assuming the compute meets the update criteria mentioned above.
updates outside of scheduled update windows
Please be aware that Neon must occasionally perform essential
platform maintenance
outside the scheduled updates performed on Neon computes. This means that you may experience brief disruptions from time to time. To learn more, see
Platform maintenance
.
Updates on the Free Plan
On the
Free Plan
, updates are scheduled and applied automatically. You can check your project's settings for updates. We'll post a notice there at least
1 day
ahead of a planned update, letting you know when it's coming.
To view planned updates:
Go to the Neon project dashboard.
Select
Settings
>
Updates
.
If you want to apply an update ahead of the scheduled date, see
Applying updates ahead of schedule
.
Updates on paid plans
On Neon's paid plans, you can set a preferred update window by specifying the day and hour. Updates will be applied within this window, letting you plan for the required compute restart.
You can specify an update window in your Neon project's settings or using the Neon API.
Neon Console
API
In the Neon Console:
Go to the Neon project dashboard.
Select
Settings
>
Updates
.
Choose a day of the week and an hour. Updates will occur within this time window and take only a few seconds.
You can check your project's settings for upcoming updates. We'll post a notice there at least
7 days
ahead of a planned update, letting you know when it's coming.
Check for updates using the Neon API
You can retrieve your update window and check for planned updates using the
Retrieve project details
endpoint.
To get your project details, send the following request, replacing
<your_project_id>
with your Neon project ID, and
$NEON_API_KEY
with your
Neon API key
:
curl
--request
GET
\
--url
https://console.neon.tech/api/v2/projects/
<
your_project_i
d
>
\
--header
'accept: application/json'
\
--header
'authorization: Bearer $NEON_API_KEY'
In the response, locate the
maintenance_window
field. It specifies the selected weekday and hour for updates. For Free Plan accounts, the update window is set by Neon. Paid plan accounts can
choose a preferred update window
. The
weekdays
value is a number from 1 to 7, representing the day of the week.
{
...
"settings"
:
{
"maintenance_window"
:
{
"weekdays"
:

:
"08:00"
}
,
}
"maintenance_scheduled_for"
:
"2025-02-07T07:00"
...
}
If there's a planned update, you'll also find a
maintenance_scheduled_for
field in the response body. This value matches the
start_time
in your
maintenance_window
but is formatted as a timestamp. If the
maintenance_scheduled_for
field in not present in the response, this means there is no planned update at this time.
Applying updates ahead of schedule
Computes receive available updates immediately upon restart. For example, if Neon notifies you about an upcoming update, you can apply it right away by restarting the compute. However, the notification won't be cleared in this case. When the planned update time arrives, no further action will be taken since the compute is already updated.
If a compute regularly scales to zero, it will receive updates when it starts up again. In such cases, you may not need to pay much attention to update notifications, as updates will be applied naturally through your compute's stop/start cycles.
For compute restart instructions, see
Restart a compute
.
Updating large computes
Computes larger than 8 CU or set to scale beyond 8 CU are not updated automatically (
scheduled updates do not apply
). To apply updates, you'll need to restart them manually. A restart may occur automatically due to
scale to zero
, but if scale to zero is disabled or your compute runs continuously, please plan for manual restarts.
Neon typically releases compute updates weekly, so we recommend scheduling weekly compute restarts.
For restart instructions, see
Restart a compute
.
Handling connection disruptions during compute updates
Most Postgres connection drivers include built-in retry mechanisms that automatically handle short-lived connection interruptions. This means that for most applications, a brief restart should result in minimal disruption, as the driver will transparently reconnect.
However, if your application has strict availability requirements, you may want to ensure that your connection settings are configured to allow for retries. Check your driver's documentation for options like connection timeouts, retry intervals, and connection pooling strategies. Your configuration should account for the few seconds it takes to apply updates to your Neon compute. For related information, see
Build connection timeout handling into your application
.
If your application or integration uses the
Neon API
or
SDKs
that wrap the Neon API, we recommend building in the same type of retry logic.

Upgrading your Postgres version
Learn how upgrade to a new major Postgres version in Neon
This topic describes how to upgrade your Neon project from one
major
Postgres version to a newer one.
Postgres version numbers consist of a
major
and a
minor
version number. For example, in the version number 16.1, 16 is the major version number and the 1 is the minor version number.
Neon manages
minor
Postgres version upgrades for you, as per the
Neon Postgres Version Support Policy
. Typically, no user action is required for
minor
version upgrades. Neon deploys minor versions soon after they become available. However, upgrading to a new major Postgres version is a manual task that must be performed by you.
Each Neon project is tied to a specific Postgres major version, which you selected when creating your Neon project.
You can check your Neon project's Postgres version in the
Settings
widget on
Project Dashboard
or by running the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
or any SQL client connection to your database:
SELECT
version
();
Before you begin
Review the
PostgreSQL Release Notes
for the new Postgres version. Major Postgres versions often introduce user-visible incompatibilities, so review the release notes for these changes. While you can upgrade directly to a new major Postgres version without going through each intermediate version, make sure you review the release notes for any skipped versions, as they may contain changes relevant to your upgrade.
Optionally, you may want to run some performance tests of your current database to set a benchmark for post-upgrade comparison.
Performing the upgrade
1. Create a Neon project with the new Postgres version
Start by creating a new Neon project with the desired Postgres version. For instructions, see
creating a new Neon project
.
At this time, you may also want to apply any specific configurations to your new Neon project that exist in your current Neon project. For example, you may have configured settings for the following Neon features that you want to implement in your new Neon project:
Compute size
Autoscaling
Scale to Zero
Protected branches
IP Allow
Alternatively, you can apply these configurations after migrating your data.
2. Migrate your data using one of the following methods
Import Data Assistant
For databases under 10GB, Neon's
Import Data Assistant
provides the simplest way to migrate between Neon projects with different Postgres versions. Just create a new project with your desired Postgres version, then use the database connection string from your existing Neon project to import the data.
Dump and restore
Neon supports the following dump and restore options:
Migrate data with pg_dump and pg_restore
This method requires dumping data from your current Neon project with
pg_dump
and loading the data into the new Neon project using
pg_restore
. Some downtime will be required between the dump and restore operations.
Migrate data from one Neon project to another by piping data from pg_dump to pg_restore
If your database is small, you can use this method to pipe
pg_dump
output directly to
pg_restore
to save time. While this method is a bit simpler, we recommend it only for small databases, as it is susceptible to failures during lengthy data migrations.
Logical replication
The logical replication method can be used to achieve a near-zero downtime migration. Once the data in the new Neon project is synced with the data in the Neon project running the older version of Postgres, you can quickly switch your applications to the database. This method is recommended for active databases that cannot afford much downtime. For instructions, see
Logical Replication
.
Notes
Neon does not support the
pg_dumpall
utility. If upgrading via dump and restore, dumps must be performed one database at a time using
pg_dump
.
Neon does not yet support upgrading using
pg_upgrade
. Support for this utility is being considered for a future release.
If you choose a dump and restore method, it is recommended that you use
pg_dump
and
pg_store
programs from the newer version of Postgres, to take advantage of any enhancements introduced in the newer version. Current releases of the these programs can read data from all previous Postgres versions supported by Neon.
3. Switch over your applications
After the migration is complete and you have verified that your new database is working as expected, you can switch your application over to the database in your new Neon project by swapping out your current database connection details for your new database connection details.
You can find the connection details for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. This opens the
Connect to your database
modal. See
Connect from any application

Neon Postgres Version Support Policy
This topic outlines
Neon's Postgres Version Support Policy
.
The official Postgres versioning policy
To better understand
Neon's Postgres Version Support Policy
, it’s helpful to first familiarize yourself with the official Postgres versioning policy and numbering system. You can refer to the official
PostgreSQL Versioning Policy
documentation for details, but here’s a condensed summary:
Major versions
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group releases a new major version approximately once per year.
Each major version is supported for five years from its initial release.
After five years, a final minor version is released, and the major version reaches end-of-life (EOL) and is no longer supported.
Minor releases
Minor releases include only bug fixes and security patches, and are issued
at least
once every three months. Minor releases do not introduce new features.
The minor release schedule is available in the
official PostgreSQL roadmap
.
Critical bugs or security issues may result in an unscheduled release outside the regular minor release roadmap if the issue is deemed too urgent to delay.
A minor release is issued for all supported major versions simultaneously.
Occasionally, manual actions are necessary after a minor version upgrade. The PostgreSQL Global Development Group strives to minimize these situations, but they do occur. Any exceptions, required manual steps, or incompatibilities introduced in minor releases are detailed in the
PostgreSQL release notes
.
Postgres version numbering
The major version is indicated by the first part of the version number, such as the "16" in "16.1".
The minor release is indicated by the second part of the version number, such as the "1" in "16.1".
Neon Version Support Policy
Neon is committed to providing stability and hassle-free maintenance. You select the major version of Postgres when
creating a Neon project
, and Neon automatically updates your chosen Postgres version to the latest minor release soon after it becomes available. Typically, no user action is required for minor release updates.
Minor release updates are announced in the
Neon Changelog
.
To check your current Postgres major and minor version, you can run the following query from the
Neon SQL Editor
or any SQL client connection to your database:
SELECT
version
();
Your Postgres major version is also displayed in the
Project settings
widget on your Neon
Project Dashboard
.
Minor releases
In Neon, an instance of Postgres runs on each compute in your Neon project. When the PostgreSQL Global Development Group releases a new minor version, Neon automatically updates your computes to the new minor version. Typically, no user action is required for minor version updates. While we aim to make the new minor version available at the same time as the official Postgres release, these updates may occur a few days later than the official release date.
Once a new minor version is available on Neon, it is applied the next time your compute restarts (for any reason). For example, if your compute suspends due to inactivity, the compute will be updated to the new minor version the next time it restarts due to a user-initiated or control-plane initiated action that wakes the compute. If your compute is always active (i.e., it never stops due to regular database activity or because you disabled
scale to zero
), and you want to force a restart to pick up the latest update, see
Restart a compute
.
Neon only supports the latest minor release for each major Postgres version. For example, when 16.4 is the latest minor release of Postgres version 16, it is no longer possible run a Neon compute with version 16.3.
Neon does not support skipping minor releases or downgrading to a previous minor release.
Manual actions after minor release upgrades
As a managed service, Neon strives to manage all minor version updates automatically, minimizing the need for user intervention. However, certain updates, such as security fixes, may require decisions that depend on your application and cannot be fully automated.
In such cases, your action may occasionally be required. When this occurs — which is infrequently — we will notify you through appropriate communication channels to ensure you are aware of any necessary steps.
Major versions
Neon currently supports Postgres 14, 15, 16, and 17. In the future, Neon intends to
support the five latest major Postgres versions, in alignment with the official Postgres version support policy.
Major version upgrades
Each Neon project is created with a specific Postgres major version. Upgrading to a newer major version requires
creating a new Neon project
with the desired Postgres version and migrating your data to the new Neon project. For more information, see
Upgrading your Postgres version

Join tables
These examples illustrate different ways to join tables in Postgres for queries involving data that spans multiple tables.
-- INNER JOIN to select rows that have matching values in both tables
SELECT
employees.name, departments.name
AS
department_name
FROM
employees
INNER JOIN
departments
ON
employees.department_id
=
departments.id;
-- LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN) to include all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table
SELECT
employees.name, departments.name
AS
department_name
FROM
employees
LEFT JOIN
departments
ON
employees.department_id
=
departments.id;
-- RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN) to include all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table
SELECT
employees.name, departments.name
AS
department_name
FROM
employees
RIGHT JOIN
departments
ON
employees.department_id
=
departments.id;
-- FULL OUTER JOIN to select rows when there is a match in one of the tables
SELECT
employees.name, departments.name
AS
department_name
FROM
employees
FULL OUTER JOIN
departments
ON
employees.department_id
=
departments.id;
-- CROSS JOIN to produce a Cartesian product of the two tables
SELECT
employees.name, projects.title
FROM
employees
CROSS JOIN
projects;
-- SELF JOIN to join a table to itself, as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement
SELECT
a.name
AS
employee_name, b.name
AS
manager_name
FROM
employees a, employees b
WHERE
a.manager_id
=
b.id;
-- Joining Multiple Tables
SELECT
employees.name, departments.name
AS
department_name, offices.location
FROM
employees
INNER JOIN
departments
ON
employees.department_id
=
departments.id
INNER JOIN
offices
ON
departments.office_id
=
offices.id;
-- Using USING() to specify join condition when both tables have the same column name
SELECT
employees.name, departments.name
AS
department_name
FROM
employees
JOIN
departments
USING
(department_id);
For additional examples and information, see
Joins between tables
.
Transactions
Transactions in Postgres ensure that a sequence of operations is executed as a single unit of work, either completely succeeding or failing together. Here are basic examples demonstrating how to use transactions in Postgres:
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN
;
-- Perform several operations within the transaction
INSERT INTO
accounts (user_id, balance)
VALUES
(
1
,
1000
);
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
-
100
WHERE
user_id
=
1
;
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
+
100
WHERE
user_id
=
2
;
-- Commit the transaction to make changes permanent
COMMIT
;
-- Start another transaction
BEGIN
;
-- Perform operations
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
-
50
WHERE
user_id
=
1
;
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
+
50
WHERE
user_id
=
3
;
-- Rollback the transaction in case of an error or if operations should not be finalized
ROLLBACK
;
-- Demonstrating transaction with SAVEPOINT
BEGIN
;
INSERT INTO
accounts (user_id, balance)
VALUES
(
3
,
500
);
-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
-
100
WHERE
user_id
=
3
;
-- Assume an error or a need to revert to the savepoint
ROLLBACK
TO
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
-- Proceed with other operations or end transaction
COMMIT
;
For additional information, see
Transactions
.
Indexes
Creating and managing indexes is crucial for improving query performance in Postgres. Here are some basic examples of how to work with indexes:
-- Create a basic index on a single column
CREATE
INDEX
idx_user_email
ON
users(email);
-- Create a unique index to enforce uniqueness and improve lookup performance
CREATE
UNIQUE INDEX
idx_unique_username
ON
users(username);
-- Create a composite index on multiple columns
CREATE
INDEX
idx_name_date
ON
events(
name
, event_date);
-- Create a partial index for a subset of rows that meet a certain condition
CREATE
INDEX
idx_active_users
ON
users(email)
WHERE
active
=
TRUE;
-- Create an index on an expression (function-based index)
CREATE
INDEX
idx_lower_email
ON
users(
LOWER
(email));
-- Drop an index
DROP
INDEX
idx_user_email;
-- Create a GIN index on a jsonb column to improve search performance on keys or values within the JSON document
CREATE
INDEX
idx_user_preferences
ON
users
USING
GIN (preferences);
-- Reindex an existing index to rebuild it, useful for improving index performance or reducing physical size
REINDEX
INDEX
idx_user_email;
-- Create a CONCURRENTLY index, which allows the database to be accessed normally during the indexing operation
CREATE
INDEX
CONCURRENTLY
idx_concurrent_email
ON
users(email);
For more information about indexes in Postgres, see
Indexes
.
Views
These examples demonstrate how to work with views in Postgres, which can help simplify complex queries, provide a level of abstraction, or secure data access.
-- Creating a view
CREATE
VIEW
employee_info
AS
SELECT
employee_id,
name
, department, position
FROM
employees
WHERE
active
=
true;
-- Querying a view
-- Just like querying a table, you can perform SELECT operations on views.
SELECT
*
FROM
employee_info;
-- Updating a view
-- This requires the view to be updatable, which generally means it must directly map to a single underlying table.
CREATE OR REPLACE
VIEW
employee_info
AS
SELECT
employee_id,
name
, department, position, hire_date
FROM
employees
WHERE
active
=
true;
-- Dropping a view
DROP
VIEW
IF
EXISTS
employee_info;
-- Creating a materialized view
-- Materialized views store the result of the query physically, and hence, can improve performance but require refreshes.
CREATE
MATERIALIZED VIEW department_summary
AS
SELECT
department,
COUNT
(
*
)
AS
total_employees,
AVG
(salary)
AS
average_salary
FROM
employees
GROUP BY
department;
-- Refreshing a materialized view
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW department_summary;
-- Querying a materialized view
SELECT
*
FROM
department_summary;
-- Dropping a materialized view
DROP
MATERIALIZED VIEW
IF
EXISTS
department_summary;
Standard views are virtual tables that do not store the data directly but represent the results of a query. Materialized views, on the other hand, store the result of the query on disk, acting like a snapshot that can boost performance for costly operations, at the expense of needing periodic refreshes to stay up-to-date.
For more information about views in Postgres, see
Views
.
Stored procedures
Stored procedures in Postgres are used for performing actions that do not necessarily return a result set, such as modifying data or working with transaction control statements like
COMMIT
and
ROLLBACK
.
-- Creating a stored procedure
CREATE
OR
REPLACE
PROCEDURE
transfer_funds(source_acc
INT
, dest_acc
INT
, transfer_amount
DECIMAL
)
LANGUAGE
plpgsql
AS
$$
BEGIN
-- Subtracting amount from source account
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
-
transfer_amount
WHERE
account_id
=
source_acc;
-- Adding amount to destination account
UPDATE
accounts
SET
balance
=
balance
+
transfer_amount
WHERE
account_id
=
dest_acc;
COMMIT
;
END
;
$$;
-- Calling the stored procedure
CALL
transfer_funds(
1
,
2
,
100
.
00
);
-- See result
SELECT
*
FROM
accounts;
For additional information and syntax, see
CREATE PROCEDURE
.
Functions
Functions in Postgres can return a single value, a record, or a set of records.
-- Creating a simple function
CREATE OR REPLACE
FUNCTION
get_employee_count
()
RETURNS
integer
AS
$$
BEGIN
RETURN
(
SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
employees);
END
;
$$
LANGUAGE
plpgsql;
-- Calling the function
SELECT
get_employee_count();
-- Creating a function that takes parameters
CREATE OR REPLACE
FUNCTION
get_employee_department
(emp_id
integer
)
RETURNS
text
AS
$$
DECLARE
department_name
text
;
BEGIN
SELECT
INTO
department_name department
FROM
employees
WHERE
id
=
emp_id;
RETURN
department_name;
END
;
$$
LANGUAGE
plpgsql;
-- Calling the function with a parameter
SELECT
get_employee_department(
1
);
Functions are typically used to perform computations. For additional information and syntax, see
CREATE FUNCTION
.
Performance tuning
To analyze query performance in Postgres, you can use a combination of built-in views, extensions, and commands that help identify performance bottlenecks and optimize query execution. Here are some examples:
Use pg_stat_statements
pg_stat_statements
is an extension that provides a means to track execution statistics of all executed SQL statements.
First, ensure the extension is enabled in your Postgres database:
CREATE
EXTENSION
IF
NOT
EXISTS
pg_stat_statements;
Then, you can query the
pg_stat_statements
view to analyze query performance. For example, this query lists the top 100 most frequently executed queries in the database:
SELECT
userid,
query,
calls,
total_exec_time
/
1000
AS
total_seconds,
mean_exec_time
AS
avg_ms
FROM
pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY
calls
DESC
LIMIT
100
;
For more information and examples, refer to our
pg_stat_statements extension guide
, or
Gathering statistics
in our query optimization guide.
Use EXPLAIN
The
EXPLAIN
command shows the execution plan of a query, detailing how tables are scanned, joined, and which indexes are used.
EXPLAIN
SELECT
*
FROM
employees
WHERE
department_id
=
1
;
Using
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
is a step further than
EXPLAIN
, as it executes the query, providing actual execution times and row counts instead of estimated values.
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
*
FROM
employees
WHERE
department_id
=
1
;
For more information, refer to the
EXPLAIN
section in our query optimization guide.
Index metrics
This query lists the number of index scans performed for all user-defined indexes.
SELECT
indexrelname, relname, idx_scan
FROM
pg_stat_user_indexes;
The query returns the number of sequential scans for all user-defined tables, indicating missing indexes.
SELECT
relname, seq_scan
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables;
For related information and more queries, see
Use indexes
in our query optimization guide.
Read metrics
This query returns the number of rows fetched per database from storage or memory. It includes rows that are accessed to fulfill queries, which may involve filtering, joining, or processing of data. Not all fetched rows are necessarily sent back to the client, as some may be intermediate results used for query processing.
SELECT
datname, tup_fetched
FROM
pg_stat_database;
This query returns the number of rows returned per database to the client after a query. This is the final set of rows after applying any filters, aggregates, or transformations specified by the query. These are typically the number of rows the client application or user sees as the query result.
SELECT
datname, tup_returned
FROM
pg_stat_database;
Write metrics
This query returns the number of rows inserted, updated, or deleted
per database
.
SELECT
datname, tup_inserted, tup_updated, tup_deleted
FROM
pg_stat_database;
This query returns the number of rows inserted, updated, or deleted
per table
.
SELECT
relname, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables;
List running queries by duration
To see currently running queries and their execution time, which can help identify long-running queries.
SELECT
pid,
now
()
-
pg_stat_activity.query_start
AS
duration, query
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE
state
=
'active'
ORDER BY
duration
DESC
;
Check for locks waiting to be granted
This query checks for locks that are currently waiting to be granted, which can be a sign of potential performance issues or deadlocks.
SELECT
pg_locks.pid, relation::regclass, mode, query
FROM
pg_locks
JOIN
pg_stat_activity
ON
pg_locks.pid
=
pg_stat_activity.pid
WHERE
NOT
granted;
Check for deadlocks by database
This query checks for deadlocks that have occurred, summarized by database.
SELECT
datname, deadlocks
FROM
pg_stat_database;
Count locks by table and lock mode
This query counts the number of locks per lock mode and table in a Postgres database, excluding system tables prefixed with
pg_
.
SELECT
mode,
pg_class.relname,
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
pg_locks
JOIN
pg_class
ON
pg_locks.relation
=
pg_class.oid
WHERE
pg_locks.mode
IS NOT NULL
AND
pg_class.relname
NOT
LIKE
'pg_%'
ESCAPE
'\'
GROUP BY
pg_class.relname,
mode;
Index usage
Run this query to assess how effectively your queries are using indexes.
SELECT
relname, seq_scan, idx_scan, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE
idx_scan
<
seq_scan
AND
idx_scan
>
0
ORDER BY
seq_scan
DESC
;
This
pg_stat_user_tables
query helps identify tables where sequential scans are more common than index scans, indicating potential areas for performance improvement through better indexing. The
pg_stat_user_tables
view is part of the Postgres
Cumulative Statistics System
.
Also, see the
Use indexes
section in our query optimization guide.
Table access statistics
This query shows how frequently tables are accessed, which can help in identifying which tables are hot for reads or writes.
SELECT
relname, seq_scan, idx_scan, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY
n_tup_ins
+
n_tup_upd
+
n_tup_del
DESC
;
VACUUM and ANALYZE statistics
This query checks the last time vacuum and analyze were run on each table, which helps ensure that your database is being maintained properly for query optimization.
SELECT
schemaname, relname, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, last_analyze, last_autoanalyze
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables;
Check for dead rows
This query fetches the names of user tables and the number of dead tuples (rows) in each.
SELECT
relname, n_dead_tup
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables;
Dead row percentage
This query calculates the percentage of dead rows compared to the total number of rows (alive and dead) in each user table within a Postgres database, helping identify potential table bloat and optimization opportunities. For related information, see
Check for table or index bloat
.
SELECT
relname,
n_dead_tup,
(
CASE
WHEN
(n_live_tup
+
n_dead_tup)
>
0
THEN
ROUND
((n_dead_tup::
FLOAT
/
(n_live_tup
+
n_dead_tup))::
numeric
,
2
)
ELSE
0
END
)
AS
dead_rows_percentage
FROM
pg_stat_user_tables;
Connections
The queries in this section use the
pg_stat_activity
view, which is part of the Postgres
Cumulative Statistics System
.

SELECT
COUNT
(
*
)
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE

Get the maximum number of connections
Get the maximum number of connections for your Postgres instance.
SHOW max_connections;
The
max_connections
setting is configured by Neon according to your compute size configuration. See
Connection limits without connection pooling
.
tip
You can use
connection pooling
to increase your concurrent connection limit.
Get the percentage of maximum connections in use
SELECT
(
SELECT
SUM
(numbackends)
FROM
pg_stat_database)
/
(
SELECT
setting::

Cancel or terminate queries and sessions
On the Neon platform, superuser privileges are not available, so you can only cancel or terminate your own queries and sessions. You cannot stop other users' queries or sessions directly.
To cancel or terminate a process:
Cancel a running query
(without ending the session):
Use
pg_cancel_backend(pid)
.
Terminate a session
(including all running queries):
Use
pg_terminate_backend(pid)
.
Examples:
Cancel a query:
SELECT
pg_cancel_backend(pid)
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE
datname
=
'databasename'
AND
pid
<>
pg_backend_pid();
Terminate a session:
SELECT
pg_terminate_backend(pid)
FROM
pg_stat_activity
WHERE
datname
=
'databasename'
AND
pid
<>

Data size
Run this query to check the logical data size for a branch in Neon.
SELECT

Alternatively, you can check the
Data size
value on the
Branches
page in the Neon Console, which gives you the data size for the databases on that branch.
note
Data size does not include the
history
that is maintained in Neon to support features like instant restore.

Neon CLI commands — branches
Use the Neon CLI to manage Neon directly from the terminal
Before you begin
Before running the
branches
command, ensure that you have
installed the Neon CLI
.
If you have not authenticated with the
neon auth
command, running a Neon CLI command automatically launches the Neon CLI browser authentication process. Alternatively, you can specify a Neon API key using the
--api-key
option when running a command. See
Connect
.
The
branches
command
The
branches
command allows you to list, create, rename, delete, and retrieve information about branches in your Neon project. It also permits setting a branch as the default branch, adding a compute to a branch, adding a
read replica
, or perforning a
schema diff
between different branches.

subcommand supports these options:
Option
Description
Type
Required
--context-file
Context file
path and file name
string
--project-id
Project ID
string
Only if your Neon account has more than one project
--name
The branch name
string
--parent
Parent branch name, id, timestamp, or LSN. Defaults to the default branch
string
--compute
Create a branch with or without a compute. By default, the branch is created with a read-write endpoint. The default value is
true
. To create a branch without a compute, use
--no-compute
boolean
--type
Type of compute to add. Choices are
read_write
(the default) or
read_only
. A read-only compute is a
read replica

--suspend-timeout
Duration of inactivity in seconds after which the compute is automatically suspended. The value
0
means use the global default. The value
-1
means never suspend. The default value is
300
seconds (5 minutes). The maximum value is
604800
seconds (1 week).
number
--cu

note
If the parent branch has more than one role or database, the
branches create
command does not output a connection URI. As an alternative, you can use the
connection-string
command to retrieve the connection URI for a branch. This command includes options for specifying the role and database. See
Neon CLI commands — connection-string
.
Create a branch with the
--output
format of the command set to
json
. This output format returns all of the branch response data, whereas the default

Postgres compatibility
Learn about Neon as a managed Postgres service
Neon is Postgres
. However, as a managed Postgres service, there are some differences you should be aware of.
Postgres versions
Neon supports Postgres 14, 15, 16, 17. You can select the Postgres version you want to use when creating a Neon project. For information about creating a Neon project, See
Manage projects
. Minor Postgres point releases are rolled out by Neon after extensive validation as part of regular platform maintenance.
Postgres extensions
Neon supports numerous Postgres extensions, and we regularly add support for more. For the extensions that Neon supports, see
Postgres Extensions
. To request support for additional extensions, please reach out to us on our
Discord Server
. Please keep in mind that privilege requirements, local file system access, and functionality that is incompatible with Neon features such as Autoscaling and Scale to Zero may prevent Neon from being able to offer support for certain extensions.
Roles and permissions
Neon is a managed Postgres service, so you cannot access the host operating system, and you can't connect using the Postgres
superuser
account. In place of the Postgres superuser role, Neon provides a
neon_superuser
role.
Roles created in the Neon Console, CLI, or API, including the default role created with a Neon project, are granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role. For information about the privileges associated with this role, see
The neon_superuser role
.
Roles created in Neon with SQL syntax, from a command-line tool like
psql
or the
Neon SQL Editor
, have the same privileges as newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These roles are not granted membership in the
neon_superuser
role. You must grant these roles the privileges you want them to have. For more information, see
Manage roles with SQL
.
Neon roles cannot install Postgres extensions other than those supported by Neon.
Postgres parameter settings
The following table shows parameter settings that are set explicitly for your Neon Postgres instance. These values may differ from standard Postgres defaults, and a few settings differ based on your Neon compute size.
note
Because Neon is a managed Postgres service, Postgres parameters are not user-configurable outside of a
session, database, or role context
, but if you are a paid plan user and require a different Postgres instance-level setting, you can contact
Neon Support
to see if the desired setting can be supported.

shared_buffers
to extend cache memory to 75% of your compute's RAM. The value differs by compute size. See
below
.

Parameter settings that differ by compute size
Of the parameter settings listed above, the
max_connections
,
maintenance_work_mem
,
shared_buffers
,
max_worker_processes
, and
effective_cache_size
differ by your compute size—defined in
Compute Units (CU)
—or by your autoscaling configuration, which has a minimum and maximum compute size. To understand how values are set, see the formulas below.
The formula for
max_connections
is:
compute_size
=
min
(max_compute_size,
8
*
min_compute_size)
max_connections
=
max
(
100
,
min
(
4000
,
450.5
*
compute_size))
For example, if you have a fixed compute size of 4 CU, that size is both your
max_compute_size
and
min_compute_size
. Inputting that value into the formula gives you a
max_connections
setting of 1802. For an autoscaling configuration with a
min_compute_size
of 0.25 CU and a
max_compute_size
of 2 CU, the
max_connections
setting would be 901.
note
It's important to note that
max_connections
does not scale dynamically in an autoscaling configuration. It's a static setting determined by your minimum and maximum compute size.
You can also check your
max_connections
setting in the Neon Console. Go to
Branches
, select your branch, then go to the
Compute
tab and select
Edit
. Your
max_connections
setting is the "direct connections" value. You can adjust the compute configuration to see how it impacts the number of direct connections.
You can use connection pooling in Neon to increase the number of supported connections. For more information, see
Connection pooling
.
The
maintenance_work_mem
value is set according to your minimum compute size RAM. The formula is:
maintenance_work_mem
=
max
(min_compute_size RAM in bytes
*
1024
/
63
,
963
,
136
,
65
,
536
)
However, you can increase the setting for the current session; for example:
SET
maintenance_work_mem
=
'10 GB'
;
If you do increase
maintenance_work_mem
, your setting should not exceed 60 percent of your compute's available RAM.

The formula for
max_worker_processes
is:
max_worker_processes
:=
12
+
floor
(
2
*
max_compute_size)
For example, if your
max_compute_size
is 4 CU, your
max_worker_processes
setting would be 20.
The formula for
shared_buffers
is:
backends
=
1
+
max_connections
+
max_worker_processes
shared_buffers_mb
=
max
(
128
, (
1023
+
backends
*
256
)
/
1024
)
The
effective_cache_size
parameter is set based on the
Local File Cache (LFC)
size of your maximum Neon compute size. This helps the Postgres query planner make smarter decisions, which can improve query performance. For details on LFC size by compute size, see the table in
How to size your compute
.
Configuring Postgres parameters for a session, database, or role
Neon permits configuring parameters that have a
user
context, meaning that these parameters can be set for a session, database, or role. You can identify Postgres parameters with a
user
context by running the following query:
SELECT
name
FROM
pg_settings
WHERE
context
=
'user'
;
To set a parameter for a specific session, use a
SET
command.
For example, the
maintenance_work_mem
parameter supports a
user
context, which lets you set it for the current session with a
SET
command:
SET
maintenance_work_mem
=
'1 GB'
;
To set parameters for a database or role:
ALTER
DATABASE
neondb
SET
maintenance_work_mem
=
'1 GB'
;
ALTER
USER
neondb_owner
SET
maintenance_work_mem
=
'1 GB'
;
Postgres logs
PostgreSQL logs can be accessed through the
Datadog integration
on Scale tier and higher plans. The integration forwards logs including error messages, database connection events, system notifications, and general PostgreSQL logs. For other plans or if you need specific log information for troubleshooting purposes, please contact
Neon Support
.
Unlogged tables
Unlogged tables are maintained on Neon compute local storage. These tables do not survive compute restarts (including when a Neon compute is placed into an idle state after a period of inactivity). This is unlike a standalone Postgres installation, where unlogged tables are only truncated in the event of abnormal process termination. Additionally, unlogged tables are limited by compute local disk space. Neon computes allocate 20 GiB of local disk space or 15 GiB x the maximum compute size (whichever is highest) for temporary files used by Postgres.
Memory
SQL queries and index builds can generate large volumes of data that may not fit in memory. In Neon, the size of your compute determines the amount of memory that is available. For information about compute size and available memory, see
How to size your compute
.
Temporary tables
Temporary tables, which are stored in compute local storage, are limited by compute local storage size.
Session context
The Neon cloud service automatically closes idle connections after a period of inactivity, as described in
Compute lifecycle
. When connections are closed, anything that exists within a session context is forgotten and must be recreated before being used again. For example, parameters set for a specific session, in-memory statistics, temporary tables, prepared statements, advisory locks, and notifications and listeners defined using
NOTIFY
/
LISTEN
commands only exist for the duration of the current session and are lost when the session ends. To avoid losing session-level contexts in Neon, you can disable Neon's
Scale to Zero
feature, which is possible on any of Neon's paid plans. However, disabling scale to zero also means that your compute will run 24/7. You can't disable scale to zero on Neon's Free plan, where your compute always suspends after 5 minutes of inactivity.
Statistics collection
Statistics collected by the Postgres
cumulative statistics system
are not saved when a Neon compute (where Postgres runs) is suspended due to inactivity or restarted. For information about the lifecycle of a Neon compute, see
Compute lifecycle
. For information about configuring Neon's scale to zero behavior, see
Scale to Zero
.
Database encoding
Neon supports UTF8 encoding (Unicode, 8-bit variable-width encoding). This is the most widely used and recommended encoding for Postgres.
To view the encoding and collation for your database, you can run the following query:
SELECT
pg_database.datname
AS
database_name
,
pg_encoding_to_char(pg_database.encoding)
AS
encoding
,
pg_database.datcollate
AS
collation,
pg_database.datctype
AS
ctype
FROM
pg_database
WHERE
pg_database.datname
=
'your_database_name'
;
You can also issue this command from
psql
or the Neon SQL Editor:
\l
note
In Postgres, you cannot change a database's encoding or collation after it has been created.
Collation support
A collation is an SQL schema object that maps an SQL name to locales provided by libraries installed in the operating system. A collation has a provider that specifies which library supplies the locale data. For example, a common standard provider,
libc
, uses locales provided by the operating system C library.
By default, Neon uses the
C.UTF-8
collation.
C.UTF-8
supports the full range of UTF-8 encoded characters.
Another provider supported by Neon is
icu
, which uses the external
ICU
library. In Neon, support for standard
libc
locales is limited compared to what you might find in a locally installed Postgres instance where there's typically a wider range of locales provided by libraries installed on your operating system. For this reason, Neon provides a full series of
predefined icu locales
in case you require locale-specific sorting or case conversions.
To view all of the predefined locales available to you, use the query
SELECT * FROM pg_collation
, or the command
\dOS+
from the
Neon SQL Editor
or an SQL client like
psql
.
To create a database with a predefined
icu
locale, you can issue a query similar to this one with your preferred locale:
CREATE
DATABASE
my_arabic_db
LOCALE_PROVIDER icu
icu_locale
'ar-x-icu'
template template0;
To specify the locale for individual columns, you can use this syntax:
CREATE
TABLE
my_ru_table
(
id
serial
PRIMARY KEY
,
russian_text_column
text
COLLATE
"ru-x-icu"
,
description
text
);
ICU also supports creating custom collations. For more information, see
ICU Custom Collations
.
For more about collations in Postgres, see
Collation Support
.
Event triggers
Postgres
event triggers
, which require Postgres superuser privileges, are currently not supported. Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events.
Attempting to create an event trigger will produce errors similar to these:
ERROR: permission denied
to
create
event
trigger

Glossary
access token
See
Token
.
active hours
A usage metric that tracks the amount of time a compute is active, rather than idle when suspended due to inactivity. The time that your compute is idle is not counted toward compute usage.
Also see
Compute hours
.
Activity Monitor
A process that monitors a Neon compute for activity. During periods of inactivity, the Activity Monitor gracefully places the compute into an idle state to save energy and resources. The Activity Monitor closes idle connections after 5 minutes of inactivity. When a connection is made to an idle compute, the Activity Monitor reactivates the compute.
Admin
An
Organizations
role in Neon with full access to all projects, permissions, invitations, and billing for an organization. Admins can manage members, assign roles, set permissions, and delete the organization.
API
See
Neon API
.
API Key
A unique identifier used to authenticate a user or a calling program to an API. An API key is required to authenticate to the Neon API. For more information, see
Manage API keys
.
apply_config
A Neon Control Plane operation that applies a new configuration to a Neon object or resource. For example, creating, deleting, or updating Postgres users and databases initiates this operation. See
System operations
for more information.
Archive storage
Cost-efficient storage where Neon archives inactive branches after a defined threshold. For Neon projects created in AWS regions, inactive branches are archived in Amazon S3 storage. For Neon projects created in Azure regions, branches are archived in Azure Blob storage.
autoscaler-agent
A control mechanism in the Neon autoscaling system that collects metrics from VMs, makes scaling decisions, and performs checks and requests to implement those decisions.
Autoscaling
A feature that automatically adjusts the allocation of vCPU and RAM for compute within specified minimum and maximum compute size boundaries, optimizing for performance and cost-efficiency. For information about how Neon implements the
Autoscaling
feature, see
Autoscaling
.
Availability Checker
A periodic load generated by the Control Plane to determine if a compute can start and read and write data. The Availability Checker queries a system database without accessing user data. You can monitor these checks, how long they take, and how often they occur, on the
Systems operations
tab on the
Monitoring
page in the Neon Console.
backpressure
A mechanism that manages the lag between the Pageserver and compute node or the Pageserver and Write-Ahead Log (WAL) service. If the WAL service runs ahead of the Pageserver, the time to serve page requests increases, which could result in increased query times or timeout errors. The backpressure mechanism manages lag using a stop-and-wait backend throttling strategy.
backup branch
A branch created by a
instant restore
operation. When you restore a branch from a particular point in time, the current branch is saved as a backup branch.
branch
An isolated copy of data, similar to a Git branch. Data includes databases, schemas, tables, records, indexes, roles — everything that comprises data in a Postgres instance. Just as a Git branch allows developers to work on separate features or fixes without impacting their main line of code, a Neon branch enables users to modify a copy of their data in isolation from their main line of data. This approach facilitates parallel database development, testing, and other features, similar to Git's code branching system.
Each Neon project is created with two branches by default:
production
- The default branch. This main line of data is referred to as
root branch
.
development
- A child branch of production. A branch created from the root branch or another branch is a
copy-on-write
clone.
You can create a branch from the current or past state of another branch. A branch created from the current state of another branch includes the data that existed on that branch at the time of branch creation. A branch created from a past state of another branch includes the data that existed in the past state.
Connecting to a database on a branch requires connecting via a compute attached to the branch. See
Connect to a branch
.
branch archiving
The automatic archiving of inactive branches in cost-efficient archive storage after a defined threshold. For more, see
Branch archiving
.
Branching
A Neon feature that allows you to create an isolated copy of your data for parallel database development, testing, and other purposes, similar to branching in Git. See
Branch
.
Business plan
A paid plan offered by Neon designed for mid-to-large enterprises that require higher compute capacity and advanced security and compliance features. See
Neon plans
.
check_availability
A Neon Control Plane operation that checks the availability of data in a branch and that a compute can start on a branch. Branches without a compute are not checked. This operation, performed by the availability checker, is a periodic load generated by the Control Plane. You can monitor these checks, how long they take, and how often they occur, on the
Systems operations
tab on the
Monitoring
page in the Neon Console.
CI/CD
Continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment.
CIDR notation
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a method used to define ranges of IP addresses in network management. It is presented in the format of an IP address, followed by a slash, and then a number (e.g., 203.0.113.0/24). The number after the slash represents the size of the address block, providing a compact way to specify a large range of IP addresses. In Neon's IP Allow feature, CIDR notation allows for efficiently specifying a block of IP addresses, especially useful for larger networks or subnets. This can be advantageous when managing access to branches with numerous potential users, such as in a large development team or a company-wide network. For related information, see
Configure IP Allow
.
cgroups
Control groups, a Linux kernel feature that allows the organization, prioritization, and accounting of system resources for groups of processes.
Collaborator
A role in Neon with limited access to specific projects shared with them. Shared projects appear under the "Shared with you" section in their personal account.
Compute
A service that provides virtualized computing resources, equipped with an operating system, a specified number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs), and a defined amount of RAM. It provides the processing power and resources for running applications. In the context of Neon, a compute runs Postgres and includes supporting components and extensions.
A
compute endpoint
is the access point for connecting to a Neon compute.
Neon creates a primary read-write compute for the project's default branch. Neon supports both read-write and
read replica
computes. A branch can have a single primary (read-write) compute but supports multiple read replica computes. The compute hostname is required to connect to a Neon Postgres database from a client or application.
compute endpoint
The network access point for connecting to a
Neon compute
.
In Neon, a compute endpoint is represented by a hostname, such as
ep-aged-math-668285.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech
, which directs traffic to the appropriate Neon compute. Additional attributes further define a compute endpoint, including
project_id
,
region_id
,
branch_id
, and
type
. These attributes specify the associated Neon project, branch, cloud service region, and whether the endpoint is read-write or read-only. For additional endpoint attributes, refer to the
Neon API
.
compute size
The Compute Units (CU) that are allocated to a Neon compute. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 56 CU. The number of units determines the processing capacity of the compute.
Compute Unit (CU)
A unit that measures the processing power or "size" of a Neon compute. A Compute Unit (CU) includes vCPU and RAM. A Neon compute can have anywhere from .25 to 56 CUs. See
Compute size and autoscaling configuration
.
compute hours
A usage metric for tracking compute usage. 1 compute hour is equal to 1
active hour
for a compute with 1 vCPU. If you have a compute with .25 vCPU, as you would on the Neon Free Plan, it would require 4
active hours
to use 1 compute hour. On the other hand, if you have a compute with 4 vCPU, it would only take 15 minutes to use 1 compute hour.
To calculate compute hour usage, you would use the following formula:
compute
hours
=
compute
size
*
active
hours
For more information, see
Compute
.
Also see
Active hours
.
connection pooling
A method of creating a pool of connections and caching those connections for reuse. Neon supports
PgBouncer
in
transaction mode
for connection pooling. For more information, see
Connection pooling
.
connection string
A string containing details for connecting to a Neon Postgres database. The details include a user name (role), compute hostname, and database name; for example:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
The compute hostname includes an
endpoint_id
(
ep-cool-darkness-123456
), a region slug (
us-east-2
), the cloud platform (
aws
), and Neon domain (
neon.tech
).
Connection strings for a Neon databases can be obtained by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. For information about connecting to Neon, see
Connect from any application
.
console
See
Neon Console
.
Control Plane
The part of the Neon architecture that manages cloud storage and compute resources.
copy-on-write
A technique used to copy data efficiently. Neon uses the copy-on-write technique when creating
branches
. When a branch is created, data is marked as shared rather than physically duplicated. Parent and child branches refer to the same physical data resource. Data is only physically copied when a write occurs. The affected portion of data is copied and the write is performed on the copied data.
create_branch
A Neon Control Plane operation that creates a branch in a Neon project. For related information, see Manage branches. See
System operations
for more information.
create_timeline
Sets up storage and creates the default branch when a Neon
project
is created. See
System operations
for more information.
data-at-rest encryption
A method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in
NVMe SSD volumes
. The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an XTS-AES-256 block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.
Data transfer
A usage metric that measures the total volume of data transferred out of Neon (egress) during a billing period. Egress also includes data transferred from Neon via Postgres logical replication to any destination, including Neon itself. Neon does not charge for data transfer, but Free Plan projects are limited to 5 GB per month. See
Data transfer
.
Database
A named collection of database objects. A Neon project is created with a database that resides in the default
public
schema. If you do not specify a name for the database when creating a Neon project, it's created with the name
neondb
. A Neon project can contain multiple databases. Users cannot manipulate system databases, such as the
postgres
,
template0
, or
template1
databases.
database branching
See
Branching
.
database fleet
A collection of database instances, typically managed as a single entity.
decoder plugin
Utilized in PostgreSQL replication architecture to decode WAL entries into a format understandable by the subscriber. The
pgoutput
decoder plugin is the default decoder, with alternatives like
wal2json
for specific use cases. Neon supports
pgoutput
and
wal2json
. See
Postgres logical replication concepts
.
dedicated resources
Resources including compute and storage dedicated to a single Neon account.
delete_tenant
A Neon Control Plane operation that deletes stored data when a Neon project is deleted. See
System operations
for more information.
Endpoint ID
A string that identifies a Neon compute endpoint. Neon Endpoint IDs are generated Heroku-like memorable random names, similar to
ep-calm-flower-a5b75h79
. These names are always prefixed by
ep
for "endpoint". You can find your Endpoint ID by navigating to your project in the Neon Console, selecting
Branches
from the sidebar, and clicking on a branch. The
Endpoint ID
is shown in the table under the
Computes
heading.
Egress
The data transferred out of the Neon service to an external destination. See
Data transfer
.
Enterprise plan
A custom volume-based paid plan offered by Neon. See
Neon plans
.
Free Plan
See
Neon Free Plan
.
GB-month
In Neon,
GB-month
is a unit of measure representing the storage of 1 gigabyte (GB) of data for one month. A gigabyte is defined as 10^9 bytes (1,000,000,000 bytes). Storage usage is measured periodically and accumulated over the billing period. At the start of each billing period, GB-month usage resets to zero.
GB-month usage reflects both the amount of storage used and how long it was used. For example, storing 10 GB for an entire month results in
10 GB-months
, while storing 10 GB for half a month results in
5 GB-months
.
Deleting data will reduce the rate at which GB-month usage increases from that point forward, but it does not decrease the GB-month usage accrued up to that point.
History
The history of data changes for all branches in your Neon project. A history is maintained to support
instant restore
. For more information, see
Storage details
.
Instant restore
Restoration of data to a state that existed at an earlier time. Neon retains a history of changes in the form of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) records, which allows you to restore data to an earlier point. A instant restore is performed by creating a branch using the
Time
or
LSN
option.
By default, Neon retains a history of changes for
1 day
across all plans to help avoid unexpected storage costs. You can increase the retention window to 24 hours for
Neon Free Plan
users, 7 days for
Launch
, 14 days for
Scale
, and 30 days for
Business
plan users. Keep in mind that this will increase your storage usage and may lead to higher costs, especially if you have many active branches.
For more information about this feature, see
Branching — Instant restore
.
IP Allow
A Neon feature used to control which IP addresses can access databases in a Neon project, often utilized to restrict public internet access. See
IP Allow
.
IP allowlist
An IP allowlist is a security measure used in network and database management. It specifies a list of IP addresses that are permitted to access a certain resource. Any IP address not on the list is automatically blocked, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can gain access. In Neon,
IP Allow
is a
Scale
and
Business
plan feature that can be used to control access to the branch where your database resides. For more information, see
Configure the IP Allow list
.
Kubernetes
An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Kubernetes cluster
A set of interconnected nodes that run containerized applications and services using Kubernetes, an open-source orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The cluster consists of at least one control plane node, which manages the overall state of the cluster, and multiple worker nodes, where the actual application containers are deployed and executed. The worker nodes communicate with the control plane node to ensure the desired state of the applications is maintained.
Kubernetes node
A worker machine in a Kubernetes cluster, which runs containerized applications.
Kubernetes scheduler
A component of Kubernetes that assigns newly created pods to nodes based on resource availability and other constraints.
KVM
Kernel-based Virtual Machine, a virtualization infrastructure built into the Linux kernel that allows it to act as a hypervisor for virtual machines.
Launch plan
A paid plan offered by Neon that provides all of the resources, features, and support you need to launch your application. It's ideal for startups and growing businesses or applications. See
Neon plans
.
live migration
A feature provided by some hypervisors, such as QEMU, that allows the transfer of a running virtual machine from one host to another with minimal interruption.
Local File Cache
The Local File Cache (LFC) is a layer of caching that stores frequently accessed data from the storage layer in the local memory of the compute. This cache helps to reduce latency and improve query performance by minimizing the need to fetch data from the storage layer repeatedly. The LFC acts as an add-on or extension of Postgres
shared buffers
. In Neon the
shared_buffers
parameter
scales with compute size
. The LFC extends cache memory up to 75 % of your compute's RAM.
logical data size
For a Postgres database, it is the size of the database, including all tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures. In Neon, a branch can have multiple databases. The logical data size for a branch is therefore equal to the total logical size of all databases on the branch.
logical replication
A method of replicating data between databases or platforms, focusing on replicating transactional changes (like
INSERT
,
UPDATE
,
DELETE
) rather than the entire database, enabling selective replication of specific tables or rows. Neon supports logical replication of data to external destinations. See
Logical replication
.
LSN
Log Sequence Number. A byte offset to a location in the
WAL stream
. The Neon branching feature supports creating branches with data up to a specified LSN.
LRU policy
Least Recently Used policy, an algorithm for cache replacement that evicts the least recently accessed items first.
Monitoring Dashboard
A feature of the Neon Console that provides several graphs to help you monitor system and database metrics, updated in real time based on your usage data.
Member

A named organization entity in Neon that groups multiple Neon users under a shared account. See
Organization
for details.
NeonVM
A QEMU-based tool used by Neon to create and manage VMs within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing for the allocation and deallocation of vCPU and RAM. For more information, refer to the NeonVM source in the
neondatabase/autoscaling
repository.
non-default branch
Any branch in a Neon project that is not designated as the
default branch
. For more information, see
Non-default branch
.
Organization
A feature in Neon that enables teams to collaborate on projects under a shared account. Organizations provide centralized management for billing, user roles, and project collaboration. Members can be invited to join, and roles such as Admin, Member, and Collaborator determine access and permissions within the organization.
Admins oversee all aspects of the organization, including managing members, permissions, billing, and projects. Members have access to all organizational projects but cannot manage billing or members. Collaborators have limited access to specific projects shared with them and do not have access to the organization dashboard.
Organizations are available on paid plans and can be created from scratch or by converting a personal account into an organization. For more, see
Organizations
.
Page
An 8KB unit of data, which is the smallest unit that Postgres uses for storing relations and indexes on disk. In Neon, a page is also the smallest unit of data that resides on a Pageserver. For information about Postgres page format, see
Database Page Layout
, in the
PostgreSQL Documentation
.
Paid plan
A paid Neon service plan. See
Neon plans
.
Pageserver
A Neon architecture component that reads WAL records from Safekeepers to identify modified pages. The Pageserver accumulates and indexes incoming WAL records in memory and writes them to disk in batches. Each batch is written to an immutable file that is never modified after creation. Using these files, the Pageserver can quickly reconstruct any version of a page dating back to the defined restore window. Neon retains a history for all branches.
The Pageserver uploads immutable files to cloud storage, which is the final, highly durable destination for data. After a file is successfully uploaded to cloud storage, the corresponding WAL records can be removed from the Safekeepers.
passwordless authentication
The ability to authenticate without providing a password. Neon’s
Passwordless auth
feature supports passwordless authentication.
peak usage
Peak usage is the highest amount of a resource (like storage or projects) you’ve used during the current billing period. If you go over your plan’s limit, extra charges are added in set increments. You’re charged for these extra units from the date you went over the limit, with the charges prorated for the rest of the month.
point-in-time restore (PITR)
A database recovery capability that allows restoring data to a specific moment in the past using Write-Ahead Log (WAL) records. In Neon, this capability is implemented through the instant restore feature, which performs point-in-time restores with near-zero delay.
pooled connection string
A pooled connection string in Neon includes a
-pooler
option, which directs your connection to a pooled connection port at the Neon Proxy. This is an example of a pooled connection:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
A pooled connection can support a high number of concurrent users and is recommended for use with serverless and edge functions. For more information, see
Connection pooling
.
You can obtain a pooled connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Select the
Connection pooling
option to add the
-pooler
option to the connection string. For further instructions, see
How to use connection pooling
.
PostgreSQL
An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.
Postgres role
A Postgres role is an entity that can own database objects and has privileges to perform database actions.
A Postgres role named
neondb_owner
is created with each Neon project by default. This role owns the ready-to-use
neondb
database, also created by default with each new Neon project. This role and any additional role created in the Neon Console, API, or CLI is assigned the
neon_superuser
role, which allows creating databases, roles, and reading and writing data in all tables, views, sequences. Roles created with SQL are created with the same basic
public schema privileges
granted to newly created roles in a standalone Postgres installation. These users are not assigned the
neon_superuser
role. They must be selectively granted permissions for each database object. For more information, see
Manage database access
.
Older projects may have a
web-access
system role, used by the
SQL Editor
and Neon’s
Passwordless auth
. The
web-access
role is system-managed. It cannot be modified, removed, or used in other authentication scenarios.
Private Networking
A feature in Neon that allows secure connections to Neon databases through AWS PrivateLink, bypassing the open internet. This ensures all data traffic remains within AWS's private network for enhanced security and compliance. See
Private Networking
.
default branch
A designation that is given to a
branch
in a Neon project. Each Neon project is initially created with a
root branch
called
production
, which carries the
default branch
designation by default.
The default branch has a larger compute hour allowance on the Free Plan. For users on paid plans, the compute associated with the default branch is exempt from the limit on simultaneously active computes, ensuring that it is always available.
You can change your default branch, but a branch carrying the default branch designation cannot be deleted.
For more information, see
default branch
.
Project
A collection of branches, databases, roles, and other project resources and settings. A project contains a primary
compute
that runs Postgres. It may also include
read replicas
. A Neon account may have multiple projects.
Project ID
A string that identifies your Neon project. Neon Project IDs are generated Heroku-like memorable random names, similar to
cool-forest-86753099
. You can find your project ID by navigating to your project in the Neon Console and selecting
Settings
from the sidebar. The project ID is also visible in the Neon Console URL after navigating to a project:
https://console.neon.tech/app/projects/cool-forest-86753099
Project Collaboration
A feature that lets you invite other Neon users to work on a project together. Note that organization members don't need to be added as collaborators since they automatically get access to all organization projects. See
Invite collaborators
for more information.
Project storage
The total volume of data stored in your Neon project. Also, a billing metric that measures the total volume of data and history, in GB-hours, stored in your Neon project. See
Storage
.
prorate
Adjusting a payment or charge so it corresponds to the actual usage or time period involved, rather than charging a full amount. Neon prorates the cost for extra units of storage when you exceed your plan's allowance. For example, if you purchase an extra unit of storage halfway through the monthly billing period, you are only charged half the unit price.
Proxy
A Neon component that functions as a multitenant service that accepts and handles connections from clients that use the Postgres protocol.
Protected Branches
A feature in Neon you can use to designate a Neon branch as "protected", which enables a series of protections:
Protected branches cannot be deleted.
Protected branches cannot be
reset
.
Projects with protected branches cannot be deleted.
Computes associated with a protected branch cannot be deleted.
New passwords are automatically generated for Postgres roles on branches created from protected branches.
See below
.
With additional configuration steps, you can apply IP Allow restrictions to protected branches only. The
IP Allow
feature is available on the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plans. See
below
.
Protected branches are not
archived
due to inactivity.
The protected branches feature is available on all Neon paid plans. Typically, the protected branch status is given to a branch or branches that hold production data or sensitive data. For information about how to configure a protected branch, refer to our
Protected branches guide
.
Publisher
In the context of logical replication, the publisher is the primary data source where changes occur. It's responsible for sending those changes to one or more subscribers. A Neon database can act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See
Logical replication
.
QEMU
A free and open-source emulator and virtualizer that performs hardware virtualization.
RAM
Random Access Memory, a type of computer memory used to store data that is being actively processed.
read replica
A read replica in Neon is a compute instance that connects to the same underlying storage as the primary compute but operates in read-only mode. It lets you offload read queries from your primary compute to improve performance and scalability, especially for analytical or reporting workloads. Read replica computes can be added or removed without affecting the primary compute.
region
The geographic location where Neon project resources are located. Neon supports creating projects in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure regions. For information about regions supported by Neon, see
Regions
.
replication slot
On the publisher database in a logical replication setup, replication slots track the progress of replication to ensure no data in the WAL is purged before the subscriber has successfully replicated it, thus preventing data loss or inconsistency. See
Postgres logical replication concepts
.
resale
Selling the Neon service as part of another service offering. Neon's Platform Partnership plan offers resale of the Neon service as an option. See
Neon plans
for more information.
root branch
A branch with no parent. Each Neon project starts with a root branch named
production
, which cannot be deleted and is set as the
default branch
for the project.
Neon also supports two other types of root branches that have no parent but
can
be deleted:
Backup branches
, created by instant restore operations on other root branches.
Schema-only branches
.
The number of root branches allowed in a project depends on your Neon plan.
Safekeeper
A Neon architecture component responsible for the durability of database changes. Postgres streams WAL records to Safekeepers. A quorum algorithm based on Paxos ensures that when a transaction is committed, it is stored on a majority of Safekeepers and can be recovered if a node is lost. Safekeepers are deployed in different availability zones to ensure high availability and durability.
Scale plan
A paid plan offered by Neon that provides full platform and support access. It's designed for scaling production workloads. See
Neon plans
.
Scale to Zero
A Neon feature that suspends a compute after a specified period of inactivity (5 minutes by default) to minimize compute usage. When suspended, a compute is placed into an idle state. Otherwise, the compute is in an
Active
state. Users on paid plans can disable the
Scale to Zero
feature for an "always-active" compute. For more information, see
Edit a compute
.
schema-only branch
A branch that replicates only the database schema from a source branch, without copying any of the actual data. This feature is particularly valuable when working with sensitive information. Rather than creating branches that include confidential data, you can duplicate just the database structure and then populate it with your own data.
Schema-only branches are
root branches
, meaning they have no parent. As a root branch, each schema-only branch starts an independent line of data in a Neon project.
See
Schema-only branches
.
Schema Diff
A Neon feature that lets you compare database schemas between different branches for better debugging, code review, and team collobration. See
Schema Diff
.
serverless
A cloud-based development model that enables developing and running applications without having to manage servers.
shared buffers
A memory area in Postgres for caching blocks of data from storage (disk on standalone Postgres or Pageservers in Neon). This cache enhances the performance of database operations by reducing the need to access the slower storage for frequently accessed data. Neon uses a
Local File Cache (LFC)
, which acts as an add-on or extension of shared buffers. In Neon the
shared_buffers
parameter
scales with compute size
. The LFC extends cache memory up to 75 % of your compute's RAM. For additional information about shared buffers in Postgres, see
Resource Consumption
, in the Postgres documentation.
SNI
Server Name Indication. A TLS protocol extension that allows a client or browser to indicate which hostname it wants to connect to at the beginning of a TLS handshake.
SQL Editor
A feature of the Neon Console that enables running queries on a Neon database. The SQL Editor also enables saving queries, viewing query history, and analyzing or explaining queries.
start_compute
A Neon Control Plane operation that starts a compute when there is an event or action that requires compute resources. For example, connecting to a suspended compute initiates this operation. See
System operations
for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see
Compute lifecycle
.
Storage
Where data is recorded and stored. Neon storage consists of Pageservers, which store hot data, and a cloud object store, such as Amazon S3, that stores cold data for cost optimization and durability.
Also, a usage metric that tracks the total volume of data and
history
stored in Neon. For more information, see
Storage
.
subscriber
The database or platform receiving changes from the publisher in a logical replication setup. It applies changes received from the publisher to its own data set. Currently, a Neon database can only act as a publisher in a logical replication setup. See
Logical replication
.
subscription
Represents the downstream side of logical replication, establishing a connection to the publisher and subscribing to one or more publications to receive updates. See
Postgres logical replication concepts
.
suspend_compute
A Neon Control Plane operation that suspends a compute after a period of inactivity. See
System operations
for more information. For information about how Neon manages compute resources, see
Compute lifecycle
.
technical preview
An early version of a feature or changes released for testing and feedback purposes.
tenant_attach
A Neon Control Plane operation that attaches a Neon project to storage. For example, this operation occurs when you create a new Neon project. See
System operations
for more information.
tenant_detach
A Neon Control Plane operation that detaches a Neon project from storage. For example, this operation occurs after the project as been idle for 30 days. See
System operations
for more information.
tenant_reattach
A Neon Control Plane operation that reattaches a Neon project to storage. For example, this operation occurs when a detached Neon project receives a request. See
System operations
for more information.
token
An encrypted access token that enables you to authenticate with Neon using the Neon API. An access token is generated when creating a Neon API key. For more information, see
Manage API keys
.
unpooled connection string
An unpooled connection string connects to your Neon database directly. It does not use
connection pooling
, and it looks similar to this:
postgresql://alex:AbC123dEf@ep-cool-darkness-123456.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dbname
You can obtain an unpooled connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Ensure that the
Connection pooling
option is
not
selected. A direct connection is subject to the
max_connections
limit for your compute. For more information, see
How to size your compute
.
Time Travel
A Neon feature that lets you connect to any selected point in time within your restore window and run queries against that connection. See
Time Travel
.
user
See
Neon user
and
Postgres role
.
vm-monitor
A program that runs inside the VM alongside Postgres, responsible for requesting more resources from the autoscaler-agent and validating proposed downscaling to ensure sufficient memory.
vCPU
Virtual CPU, a unit of processing power allocated to a virtual machine or compute.
WAL
See
Write-Ahead Logging
.
WAL receiver
In logical replication, on the subscriber side, the WAL receiver is a process that receives the replication stream (decoded WAL data) and applies these changes to the subscriber's database. See
Postgres logical replication concepts
.
WAL sender
In logical replication, the WAL sender is a process on the publisher database that reads the WAL and sends relevant data to the subscriber. See
Postgres logical replication concepts
.
WAL slice
Write-ahead logs in a specific LSN range.
WAL stream
The stream of data written to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) during transactional processing.
working set
A subset of frequently accessed or recently used data and indexes that ideally reside in memory (RAM) for quick access, allowing for better performance. See
how to size your compute
to learn how to set your minimum compute to an adequate size to handle your working set.
Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
A standard mechanism that ensures the durability of your data. Neon relies on WAL to separate storage and compute, and to support features such as branching and instant restore.
In logical replication, the WAL records all changes to the data, serving as the source for data that needs to be replicated.
Written data
A usage metric that measures the total volume of data written from compute to storage within a given billing period, measured in gigabytes (GB). Writing data from compute to storage ensures the durability and integrity of your data.

--api-key
Specifies your Neon API key. You can authenticate using a Neon API key when running a Neon CLI command instead of using
neon auth
. For information about obtaining an Neon API key, see
Create an API key
.
neon
<
comman
d
>
--api-key
<
neon_api_ke
y
>
To avoid including the
--api-key
option with each CLI command, you can export your API key to the
NEON_API_KEY
environment variable.
export
NEON_API_KEY
=<
neon_api_key
>
The authentication flow for the Neon CLI follows this order:
If the
--api-key
option is provided, it takes precedence and is used for authentication.
If the
--api-key
option is not provided, the
NEON_API_KEY
environment variable is used if it is set.
If both
--api-key
option and
NEON_API_KEY
environment variable are not provided or set, the CLI falls back to the
credentials.json
file created by the
neon auth
command.
If the credentials file is not found, the Neon CLI initiates the
neon auth
web authentication process.
--color
Colorize the output. This option is enabled by default, but you can disable it by specifying
--no-color
or
--color false
, which is useful when using Neon CLI commands in your automation pipelines.
--analytics
Analytics are enabled by default to gather information about the CLI commands and options that are used by our customers. This data collection assists in offering support, and allows for a better understanding of typical usage patterns so that we can improve user experience. Neon does not collect user-defined data, such as project IDs or command payloads. To opt-out of analytics data collection, specify
--no-analytics
or
--analytics false
.

Neon Launchpad
Launch an instant Neon Postgres database with zero configuration
Neon Launchpad enables instant provisioning of a Postgres database without configuration or account creation.
Built on Neon's serverless Postgres platform, it provides immediate database access for development and testing.
Access it now at
neon.new
.
Core features
The service provides the following capabilities:
Instant database provisioning with immediate connection string availability
Resource limits matching Neon's
free plan
specifications
72-hour database lifespan if not claimed
Option to claim databases with a unique claim ID and Neon account
Access methods
Browser access
Navigate to
https://neon.new
Select
Try in your browser
, which redirects to
https://neon.new/db
Receive an automatically generated connection string
Save the provided
Claim URL
to add this database to a Neon account later, or claim now
Command-line interface
Execute with your preferred package manager:
npx
yarn
pnpm
bunx
deno
npx
neondb
The source code for the CLI is open source. You can find it on GitHub:
neondb-cli
Integration with development tools
Add Postgres support to Vite projects using the
@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres
plugin:
import
postgresPlugin
from
'@neondatabase/vite-plugin-postgres'
;
import
react
from
'@vitejs/plugin-react'
;
import
{ defineConfig }
from
'vite'
;
export
default
defineConfig
({
plugins
:
[
postgresPlugin
({
env
:
'.env'
,
// Path to environment file
envKey
:
'DATABASE_URL'
,
// Environment variable to check
})
,
react
()
,
]
,
});
How the plugin works:
When running
vite dev
or
vite build
, the plugin checks if the
envKey
(default:
DATABASE_URL
) exists in your environment (default:
.env
) file
If the environment variable exists, the plugin takes no action
If the environment variable is missing, the plugin:
Automatically creates a new Neon claimable database
Adds two connection strings to your environment file:
DATABASE_URL
- Standard connection string
DATABASE_URL_POOLER
- Connection pooler string
Includes the claimable URL as a comment in the environment file
Default configuration
The service uses the following default settings:
Parameter
Value
Provider
AWS
Region
eu-central-1
Postgres version
17
Claiming a database
To persist a database beyond the 72-hour expiration period:
Access the claim URL provided during database creation
Sign in to an existing Neon account or create a new one
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the claim process
The claim URL is available:
On the Neon Launchpad interface where the connection string was displayed
As a comment in environment files (e.g.,
.env
) when using the CLI
Use cases
Neon Launchpad is designed for scenarios requiring rapid database provisioning:
Development and testing environments
Evaluation of Neon's capabilities before committing to an account
AI agent integration without authentication overhead
Quick prototyping sessions
Note that provisioned databases expire after 72 hours unless claimed as described in the previous section.
Technical implementation
The Neon Launchpad service is built on Neon's
claimable database integration
, which provides APIs for creating projects and generating transfer requests. This allows the service to provision databases immediately while deferring account creation until users choose to claim their database. You can build similar experiences to Neon Launchpad in your own application using the APIs documented in the integration guide.

note
This provider is not maintained or officially supported by Neon. Use at your own discretion. If you have questions about the provider, please contact the project maintainer.
Provider usage notes
Provider upgrades
: When using
terraform init -upgrade
to update a custom Terraform provider, be aware that changes in the provider’s schema or defaults can lead to unintended resource replacements. This may occur when certain attributes are altered or reset. For example, fields previously set to specific values might be reset to
null
, forcing the replacement of the entire resource.
To avoid unintended resource replacements which can result in data loss:
Review the provider’s changelog for any breaking changes that might affect your resources before upgrading to a new version.
For CI pipelines and auto-approved pull requests, only use
terraform init
. Running
terraform init -upgrade
should be done manually followed by plan reviews.
Run
terraform plan
before applying any changes to detect potential differences and review the behavior of resource updates.
Use
lifecycle protections
on critical resources to ensure they're not recreated unintentionally.
Explicitly define all critical resource parameters in your Terraform configurations, even if they had defaults previously.
On Neon paid plans, you can enable branch protection to prevent unintended deletion of branches and projects. To learn more, see
Protected branches
.
Provider maintenance
: As Neon enhances existing features and introduces new ones, the
Neon API
will continue to evolve. These changes may not immediately appear in community-maintained Terraform providers. If you notice that a provider requires an update, please reach out to the maintainer by opening an issue or contributing to the provider's GitHub repository.
Example application
The following example application demonstrates how to set up Terraform, connect to a Neon Postgres database, and perform a Terraform run that inserts data. It covers how to:
Use Go's
os/exec
package to run Terraform commands
Write a Go test function to validate Terraform execution
Execute Terraform commands such as
init
,
plan
, and

What is HIPAA?
HIPAA is a federal law that sets national standards for the protection of health information. It requires businesses handling PHI to implement safeguards to ensure privacy and security.
Key HIPAA terms
Protected Health Information (PHI): Any identifiable health-related data.
Covered Entity: Healthcare providers, plans, or clearinghouses that handle PHI.
Business Associate: A service provider (like Neon) that handles PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity.
Breach: Unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of PHI.
Security Rule: Safeguards to protect electronic PHI.
Privacy Rule: Rules governing how PHI is used and disclosed.
How Neon protects your data
Use and Disclosure of PHI
We only use PHI to provide our agreed-upon services and to meet legal obligations.
PHI is disclosed only as required by law or with proper authorization.
Safeguards in Place
Administrative: Policies and training to ensure compliance.
Physical: Secure access controls to data storage areas.
Technical: Encryption and access controls for electronic PHI.
Incident Reporting
We promptly report any unauthorized use or disclosure of PHI.
Breach notifications are provided within 30 days as per HIPAA requirements.
Subcontractors and Agents
Any third parties we work with are required to adhere to the same data protection standards.
We provide transparency by listing our subcontractors at
https://neon.com/hipaa-contractors
and notifying customers of any changes if you sign up to notifications
here
.
Customer Responsibilities
Customers must ensure that PHI is only stored in data rows as intended for sensitive data and should never be included in metadata, column names, table names, schema descriptions, or system-generated logs such as audit trails, query logs, or error logs.
Customers have the responsibility to configure a session timeout.
Customers need to avoid including PHI in support tickets or metadata fields.
PHI Access and Amendments
Customers can request access to audit logs by contacting
hipaa@neon.tech
.
Any updates or corrections to PHI need to be carried out by the customer.
Your rights and what to expect
Transparency: You can request details about how your PHI is being used.
Security: Our technical safeguards are designed to prevent unauthorized access.
Data Control: You retain ownership of your data; we are custodians ensuring its protection.
Availability of audit events
Audit events may not be logged if database endpoints experience exceptionally heavy load, as we prioritize database availability over capturing log events.

Security overview
At Neon, security is our highest priority. We are committed to implementing best practices and earning the trust of our users. A key aspect of earning this trust is by ensuring that every touchpoint in our system, from connections, to data storage, to our internal processes, adheres to the highest security standards.
Secure connections
Neon supports a variety of protections related to database connections:
SSL/TLS encryption
— Neon requires that all connections use SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data sent over the Internet cannot be viewed or manipulated by third parties.
Neon supports the
verify-full
SSL mode for client connections, which is the strictest SSL mode provided by PostgreSQL. When set to
verify-full
, a PostgreSQL client verifies that the server's certificate is issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA), and that the server host name matches the name stored in the certificate. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. For information about configuring
verify-full
SSL mode for your connections, see
Connect securely
.
Secure password enforcement
— Neon requires a 60-bit entropy password for all Postgres roles. This degree of entropy ensures that passwords have a high level of randomness. Assuming a perfect distribution of choices for every bit of entropy, a password with 60 bits of entropy has 2^60 (or about 1.15 quintillion) possible combinations, which makes it computationally infeasible for attackers to guess the password through brute-force methods. For Postgres roles created via the Neon Console, API, and CLI, passwords are generated with 60-bit entropy. For Postgres roles created via SQL, user-defined passwords are validated at creation time to ensure 60-bit entropy.
The Neon Proxy
— Neon places a proxy in front of your database, which helps safeguard it from unauthorized login attempts. For example, in Postgres, each login attempt spawns a new process, which can pose a security risk. The
Neon Proxy
mitigates this by monitoring connection attempts and preventing misuse. The Neon Proxy also allows us to authenticate connections before they ever reach your Postgres database.
IP Allow
— For additional connection security, the Neon Scale and Business plans offer
IP allowlist support
, which lets you to limit access to trusted IPs.
Private Networking
— This feature enables connections to your Neon databases via AWS PrivateLink, bypassing the open internet entirely. See
Private Networking
.
IP allowlist support
Neon's
IP Allow
feature, available with the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plan, ensures that only trusted IP addresses can connect to the project where your database resides, preventing unauthorized access and helping maintain overall data security. You can limit access to individual IP addresses, IP ranges, or IP addresses and ranges defined with
CIDR notation
. To learn more, see
Configure IP Allow
.
Protected branches
You can designate any branch as a "protected branch", which implements a series of protections:
Protected branches cannot be deleted.
Protected branches cannot be
reset
.
Projects with protected branches cannot be deleted.
Computes associated with a protected branch cannot be deleted.
New passwords are automatically generated for Postgres roles on branches created from protected branches.
With additional configuration steps, you can apply IP Allow restrictions to protected branches only. The
IP Allow
feature is available on the Neon
Scale
and
Business
plans. See
below
.
Protected branches are not
archived
due to inactivity.
The protected branches feature is available on all Neon paid plans. Typically, the protected branch status is given to a branch or branches that hold production data or sensitive data. For information about how to configure a protected branch, refer to our
Protected branches guide
.
Private Networking
The
Neon Private Networking
feature enables secure connections to your Neon databases via
AWS PrivateLink
, bypassing the open internet for enhanced security. This feature is available to Neon
Organization
accounts. It's not accessible to Personal Neon accounts.
Data-at-rest encryption
Data-at-rest encryption is a method of storing inactive data that converts plaintext data into a coded form or cipher text, making it unreadable without an encryption key. Neon stores inactive data in
NVMe SSD volumes
. The data on NVMe instance storage is encrypted using an
AES-256
block cipher implemented in a hardware module on the instance.
Secure data centers
Neon’s infrastructure is hosted and managed within either Amazon's or Azure's secure data centers, depending on the cloud service provider you select when setting up your project.
Amazon’s secure data centers backed by
AWS Cloud Security
. Amazon continually manages risk and undergoes recurring assessments to ensure compliance with industry standards. For information about AWS data center compliance programs, refer to
AWS Compliance Programs
.
The Microsoft cloud data centers that power Azure focus on high reliability, operational excellence, cost-effectiveness, and a trustworthy online experience for Microsoft customers and partners worldwide. Microsoft regularly tests data center security through both internal and third-party audits. To learn more, refer to
Microsoft's Datacenter security overview
.
Compliance-relevant security measures
At Neon, we implement robust technical controls to secure customer and sensitive data in alignment with SOC2, ISO27001, ISO27701 standards and GDPR and CCPA regulations. To learn more about these standards and regulations, see
Compliance
.
All systems are hosted on AWS and Azure, where we have implemented specific security measures to protect data. Below is a detailed breakdown of these compliance-relevant security measures for access control, encryption, network security, event logging, vulnerability management, backups, data deletion and retention:
Customer and Sensitive Data Encryption (AWS KMS and Azure Key Vault)
All customer and sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption at rest. For data in transit, encryption is enforced using TLS 1.2/1.3 protocols across various services. Encryption keys are managed using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and Azure Key Vault with key rotation policies in place. Only services and users with specific IAM roles can access the decryption keys, and all access is logged via AWS CloudTrail and Azure Monitor for auditing and compliance purposes.
Fine-Grained Access Control via IAM
Access to PII and customer or sensitive data is controlled through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and Microsoft Entra ID permissions. Broad access is limited to the infrastructure and security teams, while other roles operate under least-privilege principles. When additional access needed, access requests to production systems are received via Teleport, where all sessions are recorded. Only managers and on-call personnel are permitted to access production or approve production access requests.
Additionally, all infrastructure is managed through Terraform, ensuring that any changes to access controls or resources are fully auditable and version-controlled. Regular access reviews and audits are conducted to verify that access rights remain aligned with security best practices.
Data Segmentation and Isolation Using VPCs and Security Groups
In our AWS and Azure environments, workloads are segmented using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) to separate sensitive data environments from other systems. We control network access between services by using security groups, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) and Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), restricting access to only the necessary traffic. This ensures a clear separation of environments, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or lateral movement between services.
Event-Based Data Anomaly Detection via AWS GuardDuty and Logz.io
Customer data access attempts and other anomalies are continuously monitored via Logzio integration on both infrastructures. All alerts are ingested into our Logz.io SIEM for centralized logging, analysis, and correlation with other security data. This allows our Security Operations Center (SOC) to quickly detect, investigate, and respond to potential security threats.
Data Access Logging and Auditing (AWS CloudTrail & Logz.io)
All data access actions, including those involving sensitive operations, are logged using AWS CloudTrail and Azure Monitor, and forwarded to Logz.io for centralized logging and analysis. This provides full traceability of who accessed which resources, when, and from where. Logs are secured and retained for audit purposes, while any anomalies or suspicious activity trigger real-time alerts through our Security Operations Center (SOC) for immediate investigation and response.
PII Backup, Retention, and Deletion Policies with S3 Versioning
Customer data backups are stored in cloud object storage, such as Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage, with versioning enabled, allowing recovery from accidental deletions or modifications. Data is encrypted using server-side encryption (SSE) and is retained for 30 days. Data deletion is followed to ensure compliance with SOC2, ISO, GDPR and CCPA requirements, including data subject requests.
Vulnerability Management with Orca and Oligo
Our vulnerability management program, integrated with Orca and Oligo, continuously scans all AWS and Azure environments for security issues, including misconfigurations, unpatched software, and exposed credentials. We leverage tagging to classify certain data types, enabling focused monitoring and scanning based on the sensitivity of the data. Automated alerts allow us to address vulnerabilities before they pose a risk to PII or other sensitive information. The vulnerabilities are remediated according to the defined SLAs to reduce the risk.
Annual Audits and Continuous Penetration Testing
We undergo annual audits for SOC2 and ISO by two independent firms to verify the integrity and security of our systems. In addition, bi-annual penetration tests with Hackerone are performed, with results feeding into our vulnerability management program. The vulnerabilities are remediated according to the defined SLAs to reduce the risk.
To learn more about how we protect your data and uphold the highest standards of security and privacy, please visit our
Trust Center
.
GitHub secret scanning
Neon is a
GitHub Secret Scanning Partner
. If a Neon database credential or API key is detected in a GitHub repository, GitHub alerts Neon through an automated system. This system validates the credential and notifies our security team.
By integrating with GitHub Secret Scanning, Neon helps users quickly identify and mitigate exposed credentials, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
To avoid leaking secrets, follow these security best practices:
Use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.
Store sensitive information in secret management tools like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
Regularly rotate database credentials and API keys.
If you have questions about this integration or need help securing your credentials, contact us at
security@neon.tech
.
Security reporting
Neon adheres to the
securitytxt.org
standard for transparent and efficient security reporting. For details on how to report potential vulnerabilities, please visit our

Neon serverless driver
Connect to Neon from serverless environments over HTTP or WebSockets
The
Neon serverless driver
is a low-latency Postgres driver for JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to query data from serverless and edge environments over
HTTP
or
WebSockets
in place of TCP. The driver's low-latency capability is due to
message pipelining and other optimizations
.
The Neon serverless driver is now generally available (GA)
The GA version of the Neon serverless driver, v1.0.0 and higher, requires Node.js version 19 or higher. It also includes a
breaking change
but only if you're calling the HTTP query template function as a conventional function. For details, please see the
1.0.0 release notes
or read the
blog post
.
When to query over HTTP vs WebSockets:
HTTP
: Querying over an HTTP
fetch
request is faster for single, non-interactive transactions, also referred to as "one-shot queries". Issuing
multiple queries
via a single, non-interactive transaction is also supported. See
Use the driver over HTTP
.
WebSockets
: If you require session or interactive transaction support or compatibility with
node-postgres
(the popular
npm
pg
package), use WebSockets. See
Use the driver over WebSockets
.
Install the Neon serverless driver
You can install the driver with your preferred JavaScript package manager. For example:
npm
install
@neondatabase/serverless
The driver includes TypeScript types (the equivalent of
@types/pg
). No additional installation is required.
note
The Neon serverless driver is also available as a
JavaScript Registry (JSR)
package:
https://jsr.io/@neon/serverless
. The JavaScript Registry (JSR) is a package registry for JavaScript and TypeScript. JSR works with many runtimes (Node.js, Deno, browsers, and more) and is backward compatible with
npm
.
Configure your Neon database connection
You can obtain a connection string for your database by clicking the
Connect
button on your
Project Dashboard
. Your Neon connection string will look something like this:
DATABASE_URL
=
postgresql://[user
]:[password]@[neon_hostname]/[dbname]
The examples that follow assume that your database connection string is assigned to a
DATABASE_URL
variable in your application's environment file.
Use the driver over HTTP
The Neon serverless driver uses the
neon
function for queries over HTTP. The function returns a query function that can only be used as a template function for improved safety against SQL injection vulnerabilities.
For example:
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
id
=
1
;
// Safe and convenient template function usage
const
result
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM table WHERE id =
${
id
}
`
;
// For manually parameterized queries, use the query() function
const
result
=
await
sql
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1'
,
[id]);
// For interpolating trusted strings (like column or table names), use the unsafe() function
const
table
=
condition
?
'table1'
:
'table2'
;
// known-safe string values
const
result
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM
${
sql
.unsafe
(table)
}
WHERE id =
${
id
}
`
;
// Alternatively, use template literals for known-safe values
const
table
=
condition
?
sql
`table1`
:
sql
`table2`
;
const
result
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM
${
table
}
WHERE id =
${
id
}
`
;
SQL template queries are fully composable, including those with parameters:
const
name
=
'Olivia'
;
const
limit
=
1
;
const
whereClause
=
sql
`WHERE name =
${
name
}
`
;
const
limitClause
=
sql
`LIMIT
${
limit
}
`
;
// Parameters are numbered appropriately at query time
const
result
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM table
${
whereClause
}
${
limitClause
}
`
;
You can use raw SQL queries or tools such as
Drizzle-ORM
,
kysely
,
Zapatos
, and others for type safety.

);
const

=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id =
${

}
`
;
// or using query() for parameterized queries
const
posts
=
await
sql
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1'
,
[postId]);
// `posts` is now [{ id: 12, title: 'My post', ... }] (or undefined)
note
The maximum request size and response size for queries over HTTP is 64 MB.
neon function configuration options
The
neon(...)
function returns a query function that can be used as a template function, with additional properties for special cases:
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
// Use as a template function (recommended)
const
rows
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id =
${
postId
}
`
;
// Use query() for manually parameterized queries
const
rows
=
await
sql
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1'
,
[postId]);
// Use unsafe() for trusted string interpolation
const
table
=
'posts'
;
// trusted value
const
rows
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM
${
sql
.unsafe
(table)
}
WHERE id =
${
postId
}
`
;
By default, the query function returns only the rows resulting from the provided SQL query, and it returns them as an array of objects where the keys are column names. For example:
const
rows
=
await
sql
`SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id =
${
postId
}
`
;
// -> [{ id: 12, title: "My post", ... }]
You can customize the return format using the configuration options
fullResults
and
arrayMode
. These options are available both on the
neon(...)
function and on the query function it returns.
arrayMode: boolean
,
false
by default
The default
arrayMode
value is
false
. When it is true, rows are returned as an array of arrays instead of an array of objects:
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
,
{ arrayMode
:
true
});
const
rows
=
await
sql

fetchOptions: Record<string, any>
The
fetchOptions
option can also be passed to either
neon(...)
or the
query
function. This option takes an object that is merged with the options to the
fetch
call.
For example, to increase the priority of every database
fetch
request:
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process

const
rows
=

;
Or to implement a
fetch

import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.

=
await
sql
(
'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = $1'
,
[postId]
,
{
fetchOptions
:
{ signal
:
abortController
.signal }
,
});
// throws an error if no result received within 10s
clearTimeout
(timeout);

.
Issue multiple queries with the transaction() function
The
transaction(queriesOrFn, options)
function is exposed as a property on the query function. It allows multiple queries to be executed within a single, non-interactive transaction.
The first argument to
transaction()
,
queriesOrFn
, is either an array of queries or a non-async function that receives a query function as its argument and returns an array of queries.
The array-of-queries case looks like this:
import
{ neon }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
sql
=
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
);
const
showLatestN
=
10
;
const
[
posts
,
tags
]
=
await
sql
.transaction
(
[
sql
`SELECT * FROM posts ORDER BY posted_at DESC LIMIT
${
showLatestN
}
`
,
sql
`SELECT * FROM tags`
]
,
{
isolationLevel
:
'RepeatableRead'
,
readOnly
:
true
,
}
);
Or as an example of the function case:
const
[
authors
,
tags
]
=
await
neon
(
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
)
.transaction
((txn)
=>
[
txn
`SELECT * FROM authors`
,
txn
`SELECT * FROM tags`
,
]);
The optional second argument to
transaction()
,
options
, has the same keys as the options to the ordinary query function —
arrayMode
,
fullResults
and
fetchOptions
— plus three additional keys that concern the transaction configuration. These transaction-related keys are:
isolationMode
,
readOnly
and
deferrable
.
Note that options
cannot
be supplied for individual queries within a transaction. Query and transaction options must instead be passed as the second argument of the
transaction()
function. For example, this
arrayMode
setting is ineffective (and TypeScript won't compile it):
await sql.transaction([sql('SELECT now()', [], { arrayMode: true })])
. Instead, use
await sql.transaction([sql('SELECT now()')], { arrayMode: true })
.
isolationMode
This option selects a Postgres
transaction isolation mode
. If present, it must be one of
ReadUncommitted
,
ReadCommitted
,
RepeatableRead
, or
Serializable
.
readOnly
If
true
, this option ensures that a
READ ONLY
transaction is used to execute the queries passed. This is a boolean option. The default value is
false
.
deferrable
If
true
(and if
readOnly
is also
true
, and
isolationMode
is
Serializable
), this option ensures that a
DEFERRABLE
transaction is used to execute the queries passed. This is a boolean option. The default value is
false
.
For additional details, see
transaction(...) function
.
Use the driver over WebSockets
The Neon serverless driver supports the
Pool and Client
constructors for querying over WebSockets.
The
Pool
and
Client
constructors, provide session and transaction support, as well as
node-postgres
compatibility. You can find the API guide for the
Pool
and
Client
constructors in the
node-postgres
documentation.
Consider using the driver with
Pool
or
Client
in the following scenarios:
You already use
node-postgres
in your code base and would like to migrate to using
@neondatabase/serverless
.
You are writing a new code base and want to use a package that expects a
node-postgres-compatible
driver.
Your backend service uses sessions / interactive transactions with multiple queries per connection.
You can use the Neon serverless driver in the same way you would use
node-postgres
with
Pool
and
Client
. Where you usually import
pg
, import
@neondatabase/serverless
instead.
Node.js
Prisma
Drizzle-ORM
Vercel Edge Function
Vercel Serverless Function
import
{ Pool }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
const
pool
=
new
Pool
({ connectionString
:
process
.
env
.
DATABASE_URL
});
const
posts
=
await
pool
.query
(
'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id =$1'
,
[postId]);
pool
.end
();
Pool and Client usage notes
In Node.js and some other environments, there's no built-in WebSocket support. In these cases, supply a WebSocket constructor function.
import
{ Pool
,
neonConfig }
from
'@neondatabase/serverless'
;
import
ws
from
'ws'
;
neonConfig
.webSocketConstructor
=
ws;
In serverless environments such as Vercel Edge Functions or Cloudflare Workers, WebSocket connections can't outlive a single request. That means
Pool
or
Client
objects must be connected, used and closed within a single request handler. Don't create them outside a request handler; don't create them in one handler and try to reuse them in another; and to avoid exhausting available connections, don't forget to close them.
For examples that demonstrate these points, see
Pool and Client
.
Advanced configuration options
For advanced configuration options, see
neonConfig configuration
, in the Neon serverless driver GitHub readme.
Developing locally with the Neon serverless driver
The Neon serverless driver enables you to query data over
HTTP
or
WebSockets
instead of TCP, even though Postgres does not natively support these connection methods. To use the Neon serverless driver locally, you must run a local instance of Neon's proxy and configure it to connect to your local Postgres database.
For a step-by-step guide to setting up a local environment, refer to this community guide:
Local Development with Neon
. The guide demonstrates how to use a
community-developed Docker Compose file
to configure a local Postgres database and a Neon proxy service. This setup allows connections over both WebSockets and HTTP.

Data anonymization
new
Anonymize data in Neon branches using the PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension
When working with production data, it's crucial to ensure that sensitive user information remains protected — especially in development or testing environments. With Neon, creating branches is fast, but how do you safely clone a production branch without exposing personal data?
The
PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension (
anon
)
provides tools to mask, randomize, or obfuscate personal data, making it easy to create safe, anonymized branches for development and testing.
important
Neon currently supports static masking with the
anon
extension, where anonymization rules are applied directly to the data in your branch. Note that the
anon
extension is experimental in Neon and requires explicit activation as shown below. Dynamic masking (on-the-fly anonymization during queries) is not yet available.
This guide demonstrates two approaches to anonymize data on a Neon branch:
A manual procedure using SQL commands
An automated process using GitHub Actions workflows
Anonymize branch data manually
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
A
Neon project
with a populated parent branch
A Postgres client such as
psql
, pgAdmin, or Neon's SQL Editor
Create sample data
For this example, we'll use a
production
branch with a
users
table containing sensitive information:
CREATE
TABLE
users
(
id
SERIAL
PRIMARY KEY
,
first_name
TEXT
,
last_name
TEXT
,
email
TEXT
,
iban
TEXT
);
-- Insert sample data
DO $$
BEGIN
FOR
i
IN
1
..
100
LOOP
INSERT INTO
users (first_name, last_name, email, iban)
VALUES
(
'First Name '
||
i,
'Last Name '
||
i,
'user'
||
i
||
'@example.com'
,
'IBAN'
||
i
);
END
LOOP
;
END
$$;
Verify the data with:
SELECT
*
FROM
users
LIMIT
3
;
The output:
id
first_name
last_name
email
iban
1
First Name 1
Last Name 1
user1@example.com
IBAN1
2
First Name 2
Last Name 2
user2@example.com
IBAN2
3
First Name 3
Last Name 3
user3@example.com
IBAN3
Create a new branch
Create a branch from your
production
branch that you'll anonymize, called
anonymized-dev
in this example:
neonctl
branch
create
--project-id
<
my-project-i
d
>
--name
anonymized-dev
--parent
production
important
This creates a branch with an exact copy of your production data. The data is not yet anonymized until you run the anonymization commands below.
Enable the
anon
extension
Get a connection string for your new branch:
neonctl
cs
anonymized-dev
--project-id
<
my-project-i
d
>
Connect to the branch:
psql
"<connection_string>"
Enable experimental extensions and install
anon
:
-- Enable experimental extensions
SET
neon.allow_unstable_extensions
=
'true'
;
-- Install the anonymizer extension
CREATE
EXTENSION anon;
Choose a masking strategy
Apply security labels to define how each sensitive column should be anonymized.
In this example, we will use the faking strategy to anonymize columns in our
users
table. The faking strategy replaces sensitive data with random values that look similar to the original data but are not real:
-- Replace personal data with realistic-looking fake values
SECURITY
LABEL
FOR
anon
ON
COLUMN users.first_name
IS
'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_first_name()'
;
SECURITY
LABEL
FOR
anon
ON
COLUMN users.last_name
IS
'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_last_name()'
;
SECURITY
LABEL
FOR
anon
ON
COLUMN users.iban
IS
'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_iban()'
;
SECURITY
LABEL
FOR
anon
ON
COLUMN users.email
IS
'MASKED WITH FUNCTION anon.fake_email()'
;
Anonymize the data
With the masking strategy set, now initialize the extension and also run the anonymization process to anonymize the data:
warning
Static masking permanently modifies your data. The original values cannot be recovered after anonymization, but you can reset a branch from its parent to restore the original data.
-- Load necessary data for the anonymization functions
SELECT
anon.init();
-- Apply masking rules to transform the data
SELECT
anon.anonymize_database();
Verify the results
Check that your data has been properly anonymized:
SELECT
*
FROM
users
LIMIT
3
;
You should see the sensitive columns replaced with fake but realistic-looking values, similar to:
id
first_name
last_name
email
iban

Tips for safely anonymizing data
caution
Always double-check that you are on the correct branch before running anonymization.
Never run
anon.init()
and
anon.anonymize_database()
on your parent branch. These functions should only be executed on child branches intended for anonymization. Running them on a parent branch will permanently modify your source data.
If you reset a branch from its parent, all data returns to its original non-anonymized state and you must re-run the entire anonymization process.
Generally, you should always back up your data before making any changes. With Neon, you can quickly restore a branch to a previous state using
Instant restore
if needed, or reset from the parent branch to restore the original non-anonymized data.
Test anonymization on a small subset of data first (e.g., test with
anon.anonymize_table()
instead of
anon.anonymize_database()
).
Periodically audit your masking rules as your schema evolves to ensure all sensitive fields remain protected.
Use different anonymization strategies for different types of data, for more information see the
anon
masking functions
documentation.
To streamline your workflow, you can enable the
anon
extension and define masking rules on your parent branch. These settings will be inherited by all child branches you create, eliminating repetitive setup.
The following example shows how to
automate the creation of anonymized Neon branches
using
GitHub Actions
, triggered each time a pull request is opened or updated.
Automate data anonymization
Creating anonymized database copies for development, testing, or preview environments can be automated with GitHub Actions. The following workflow creates anonymized Neon branches automatically whenever a pull request is opened or updated.
What you'll achieve for each pull request:
Automatic creation of a new Neon branch
Installation and initialization of the PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension
Application of predefined masking rules to sensitive fields
A ready-to-use anonymized dataset for use in CI, preview environments, or manual testing
Requirements
Before setting up the GitHub Action:
A
Neon project
with a populated parent branch
The following GitHub repository secrets:
NEON_PROJECT_ID
NEON_API_KEY
tip
The Neon GitHub integration can configure these secrets automatically. See
Neon GitHub integration
.
Set up the GitHub action workflow
Create a file at
.github/workflows/create-anon-branch.yml
(or similar) with the following content. It implements the same masking rules we used in the manual approach:
note
This simple workflow example covers the basics. For production use, consider enhancing it with error handling, retry logic, and additional security controls.

Testing the workflow
To test this automation workflow:
Customize the workflow for your environment by adjusting the branch naming convention and security labels
Push the changes to your repository
Open a new pull request
Check the
Actions
tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the workflow execution
Verify the anonymized branch creation and data anonymization by:
Viewing the GitHub Actions logs
Connecting to the new branch and confirm that the original values were replaced
Checking the data in the Neon Console's
Tables
view
Cleaning up
Remember to clean up anonymized branches when they're no longer needed. You can delete them manually or automate cleanup with the
delete-branch-action
GitHub Action when PRs are closed.
Conclusion
The PostgreSQL Anonymizer extension with Neon's branching functionality provides a solution for protecting sensitive data in development workflows. By using static masking with Neon branches, you can:
Create realistic test environments without exposing sensitive information
Obfuscate sensitive information such as names, addresses, emails, and other personally identifiable details (PII)
Automate anonymization processes as part of your CI/CD pipeline
While only static masking is currently supported in Neon, this approach offers a robust solution for most development and testing use cases.
