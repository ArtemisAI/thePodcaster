fix: resolve rebase conflicts, clean routers imports

* Removed merge conflict markers from `backend/app/main.py` & `ROADMAP.md`.
* Re-wrote `backend/app/main.py` so it only imports routers present in repo.
* Added start-up checks & documentation clarifications.
* Updated Milestone 7 entries in `ROADMAP.md`, mark tasks as *Deferred*.
* Added changelog entry & TODO for missing video/library routes.

chore: improve navigation behaviour, logging infrastructure & docs

* Change navigation buttons in `frontend/index.html` to `type="button"` to
  prevent accidental form submissions that resulted in "click does nothing"
  issues on certain browsers.
* Ensure a dedicated `logs/` directory exists and exclude it (and
  `backend/logs/`) from Git & Docker contexts for cleaner images.
* Add `.dockerignore` with sensible defaults to speed up `docker build`.
* Create `docs/upload_logic.md` â€“ explains the full upload & processing flow.
* Update `ROADMAP.md` (Milestone G4 now *Planned*) and add new TODO items for
  WebSocket progress, auth, virus scan, and E2E tests.
* Changelog entry `30062025_frontend_nav_buttons_and_docs.txt` summarises these
  changes.
