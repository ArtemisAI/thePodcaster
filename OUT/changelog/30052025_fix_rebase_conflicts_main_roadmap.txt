I resolved Git rebase merge conflicts in `backend/app/main.py` and `ROADMAP.md`.
I removed conflict markers, ensured only implemented API routers are imported,
and clarified deferred Milestone 7 tasks.  This restores a clean working tree
and allows the application to start without `ModuleNotFoundError`.
