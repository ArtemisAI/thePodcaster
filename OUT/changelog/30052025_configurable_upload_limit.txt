I changed the backend configuration to support a configurable per-file upload size limit and to ensure large uploads are handled gracefully.

Specifically, I:
• Added `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` to `backend/app/config.py` and `.env.example`.
• Updated docker-compose so backend & worker containers receive the new env var.
• Implemented streaming size enforcement in `routes_audio.save_uploaded_file` which now raises a proper 413 error and cleans up partial files.
• Bumped `frontend/nginx.conf` `client_max_body_size` to 2G, letting FastAPI return helpful JSON errors instead of Nginx.
• Extended logging around uploads for easier debugging.
• Extended the roadmap with task B7.

Reason: Large podcast WAV files exceeded previous limits, causing silent failures. With these changes the limit is explicit, configurable, and robust.
