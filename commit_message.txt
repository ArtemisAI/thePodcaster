fix: resolve rebase conflicts, clean routers imports

* Removed merge conflict markers from `backend/app/main.py` & `ROADMAP.md`.
* Re-wrote `backend/app/main.py` so it only imports routers present in repo.
* Added start-up checks & documentation clarifications.
* Updated Milestone 7 entries in `ROADMAP.md`, mark tasks as *Deferred*.
* Added changelog entry & TODO for missing video/library routes.
